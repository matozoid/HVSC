# The purpose of this text document is to highlight all the tunes     #
# that are still left in HVSC which have bugs in the data which       #
# either send a tune out of synch, play a wrong note, or even worse,  #
# crash Sidplay2 or a real C64.  It also gives you all the incomplete #
# rips that are in HVSC.  Although the HVSC Crew are an extremely     #
# active and busy bunch of SID fans, there are occasions where some   #
# of the older tunes in the collection have not been checked by the   #
# original ripper before submitting to HVSC and so could have gone in #
# with bugs.  We are doing all we can to eliminate this, but would    #
# appreciate it if you could let me know of any bugged tunes you find.#
#                                                                     #
# If you are reporting a bugged tune that you have found in HVSC      #
# that is not on the below list, please give the full HVSC filename   #
# (inlcuding its path) and if concise but precise details of the      #
# problem (see examples below for suitable format.)  The name in      #
# brackets indicates who reported the bug and so you will be credited #
# the same way if you happen to find one.                             #
#                                                                     #
# If you do manage to fix a bugged tune, please mail it to myself     #
# with a description of what had to be done to fix it.                #
#                                                                     #
# NOTE: This lists only lists bugs where the SID file is definitely   #
# incompatible with Sidplay2 or a real C64.                           #
#                                                                     #
# Some of these tunes may also have been fixed which will appear in a #
# future HVSC update.                                                 #
#                                                                     #

# Bugged tunes as of HVSC 57 #
##############################

/DEMOS/A-F/Digital_II.sid
  BUG: Original has part of the samples overwritten by a ML monitor, hence
       playing "garbage" at some point (0:32-0:33 and 1:02-1:03). This rip
       has that sample repaired. No other good source known.
(iAN CooG)

/MUSICIANS/F/Feekzoid/Comfortably_Numb.sid
  BUG: Falls out of synch after around 5:10.
       Feekzoid confirmed that this tune was never finished:
       "Comfortably Numb was never finished, I actually stopped working on it
       about 1 min in... but when I discovered the file years later I jumbled
       up the patterns a bit in order to make it follow the original song as
       best as possible.. but yes... as you discovered... it falls apart later
       on."
(Stephan Schmid)

/MUSICIANS/F/Feekzoid/SceptreMix.sid
  BUG: Goes bad at around 2:30, clearly audible wrong notes at around 3:30.
       Feekzoid confirmed that this tune was never finished:
       "...the Sceptre tune was never finished. The tune was written at the end
       of my C64 days... and abandoned. Years later there was a bit of a
       clamouring for more SIDs, and I uncovered it on an old floppy disk, so
       brought them back for the hell of it."
(Stephan Schmid)
