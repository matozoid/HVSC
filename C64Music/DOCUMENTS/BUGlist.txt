# The purpose of this text document is to highlight all the tunes     #
# that are still left in HVSC which have bugs in the data which       #
# either send a tune out of synch, play a wrong note, or even worse,  #
# crash Sidplay2 or a real C64.  It also gives you all the incomplete #
# rips that are in HVSC.  Although the HVSC Crew are an extremely     #
# active and busy bunch of SID fans, there are occasions where some   #
# of the older tunes in the collection have not been checked by the   #
# original ripper before submitting to HVSC and so could have gone in #
# with bugs.  We are doing all we can to eliminate this, but would    #
# appreciate it if you could let me know of any bugged tunes you find.#
#                                                                     #
# If you are reporting a bugged tune that you have found in HVSC      #
# that is not on the below list, please give the full HVSC filename   #
# (inlcuding its path) and if concise but precise details of the      #
# problem (see examples below for suitable format.)  The name in      #
# brackets indicates who reported the bug and so you will be credited #
# the same way if you happen to find one.                             #
#                                                                     #
# If you do manage to fix a bugged tune, please mail it to myself     #
# with a description of what had to be done to fix it.                #
#                                                                     #
# NOTE: This lists only lists bugs where the SID file is definitely   #
# incompatible with Sidplay2 or a real C64.                           #
#                                                                     #
# Some of these tunes may also have been fixed which will appear in a #
# future HVSC update.                                                 #
#                                                                     #

##############################

       and background tunes.
(Ville Nurmi)

/GAMES/M-R/Rollin.sid

(Gazi)

/GAMES/UNKNOWN/Impossible_Mission_II.sid
  BUG: In-game tunes are missing (6 or 7) variants of the tune which
       is the melody you have to find in safes by blowing them up and
       then assemble and play using the tape recorder.
(Jaromir Król)

/MUSICIANS/A/Audial_Arts/Prijt_Francois/Blaze_of_Glory_Holland_Pro.sid
  BUG: Falls out of synch at around the 5:10 mark. This bug doesn't occur
       in the demo as the next part gets loaded after around one minute
       of playtime.
(Magnate)

/MUSICIANS/D/Doussis_Stello/Hero.sid
  BUG:  Has a lot of wrong sounds inside, obviously a bad rip.
        Sounds bad from 1:23
(Stello Doussis)

/MUSICIANS/F/Feekzoid/Comfortably_Numb.sid
  BUG:  Falls out of synch after around 5:10.
        Feekzoid confirmed that this tune was never finished:
        "Comfortably Numb was never finished, I actually stopped working on it
        about 1 min in... but when I disovered the file years later I jumbled
        up the patterns a bit in order to make it follow the original song as
        best as possible.. but yes... as you discovered... it falls apart later
        on."
(Stephan Schmid)

/Feekzoid/SceptreMix.sid
  BUG: Goes bad at around 2:30, clearly audible wrong notes at around 3:30.
       Feekzoid confirmed that this tune was never finished:
       "...the Sceptre tune was never finished. The tune was written at the end
       of my C64 days... and abandoned. Years later there was a bit of a
       clamouring for more SIDs, and I uncovered it on an old floppy disk, so
       brought them back for the hell of it."
(Stephan Schmid)

/MUSICIANS/T/TC/T_C_Music_005.sid
  BUG: Falls out of synch at 1:01, just like it does in the demo
       it was taken from.
(Peter Sandén)
