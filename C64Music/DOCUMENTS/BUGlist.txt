# The purpose of this text document is to highlight all the tunes     #
# that are still left in HVSC which have bugs in the data which       #
# either send a tune out of synch, play a wrong note, or even worse,  #
# crash Sidplay2 or a real C64.  It also gives you all the incomplete #
# rips that are in HVSC.  Although the HVSC Crew are an extremely     #
# active and busy bunch of SID fans, there are occasions where some   #
# of the older tunes in the collection have not been checked by the   #
# original ripper before submitting to HVSC and so could have gone in #
# with bugs.  We are doing all we can to eliminate this, but would    #
# appreciate it if you could let me know of any bugged tunes you find.#
#                                                                     #
# If you are reporting a bugged tune that you have found in HVSC      #
# that is not on the below list, please give the full HVSC filename   #
# (inlcuding its path) and if concise but precise details of the      #
# problem (see examples below for suitable format.)  The name in      #
# brackets indicates who reported the bug and so you will be credited #
# the same way if you happen to find one.                             #
#                                                                     #
# If you do manage to fix a bugged tune, please mail it to myself     #
# with a description of what had to be done to fix it.                #
#                                                                     #
# NOTE: This lists only lists bugs where the SID file is definitely   #
# incompatible with Sidplay2 or a real C64.                           #
#                                                                     #
# Some of these tunes may also have been fixed which will appear in a #
# future HVSC update.                                                 #
#                                                                     #

       "Comfortably Numb was never finished, I actually stopped working on it
       about 1 min in... but when I disovered the file years later I jumbled

       best as possible.. but yes... as you discovered... it falls apart later
       on."

       "...the Sceptre tune was never finished. The tune was written at the end
       of my C64 days... and abandoned. Years later there was a bit of a
       clamouring for more SIDs, and I uncovered it on an old floppy disk, so
       brought them back for the hell of it."
