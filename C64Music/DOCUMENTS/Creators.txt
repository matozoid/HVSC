The grunt work!  Sorted and searched and sorted and searched.  :)
Eliminated a billion repeats by hand (or ear?).  Dug up a few C64 titles
for friends to rip.  Contacted several composers asking (begging) for help.
Corrected thousands of credits.  Made the original release of the UPDATE
tool and other SID tools such as SID2LFN.  Now attempting to become a 
novice ripper.

Comments
--------
Looking back to the old days on the C64, I can't remember when I first
started to really listen to the music, but I distinctively remember being
blown away by Commando (Hubbard) and its very famous high-score music.
After that, it was all of the tunes jammed into Lettermaker/Futurewriter
that really got me hooked.  No other system since has been able to compare.

Also, thanks to Strider of FairLight for introducing me to SIDPlay!

C64 History
-----------
Upgraded from a Vic20 to a C64 in 1983.  Started INC in 1987 which
specialized in importing/exporting software from/to Europe, and we also
managed a few USA cracks.  Kept C64 to this day in order to still hear
the music (and perhaps play an old game or two).

SID music simply makes me feel good.  The songs from the good old 64 have
a musical honesty, brought by the crude environment in which they were
created.  And every now and then, the quality of the these compositions
really astonish me.  True art, of our time.

Indirectly was responsible for forwarding many tunes.  Maintained the SID

Hunt Web page, which is where to go to request a tune to be ripped for 
HVSC.  Rumoured to be writing his first book, "The Power of Perl"
at the same time ;)

Comments
--------
C64 music is the alpha and the omega in my life. I knew there was something
special going on when I heard LOCO from Ben. Then I learned it was really
Jarre - so I got into Jarre. I remember when I first heard Commando by Rob -
I was just totally blown away, but the funny thing is that nobody in my
neighborhood really understood why I was so crazy about such blip-blop
computer muzak... The rest is history, and music in general became an
essential part of my life.

C64 History
-----------
The first computer I have ever touched: a ZX-81 at age 6. Then came
Spectrum, something I really wanted but never got 'cause my Dad bought me a
C-64 instead.  I don't think I will ever regret his decision. :) Have never
been into the scene, but I had good contact with swappers, so I was always
flooded with games and demos (who wasn't? ;). Unfortunately, I had to sell
my C64 before we moved to the US from Hungary. I still remember that sad
date: on October 6, 1991 I waved goodbye to my beloved machine... HVSC and
Michael's SIDPLAY has truly saved my sanity!!!

SID music is an integral part of my life. Not a single day passes without 
me spending at least an hour listening to my favourite tunes. 
I remember the early spring of 1987. I was 11 years old, sitting in 
school, with my walkman, playing a tape of Commando by Rob Hubbard. My 
teacher took it away... Man, I was pissed ! :)
Gosh, this was FOURTEEN years ago !!

Comments

I still remember the days passed listening to C64 music. I often loaded
some games only to hear their awesome music. I then recorded many tapes
with hours of C64 musics on them to hear them whenever I was willing to.
Most people don't understand the real meaning of music. It doesn't matter
the sounds, doesn't matter the quality, the only thing that should be
considered are the melodies. Most people think C64 music is crap only
because it doesn't feature real drums or famous musicians' speech..
well, they'll never know what they're missing.

C64 History
-----------
The first computer I've ever seen was a ZX-Spectrum at the age of 7
...damn, I can't really remember what I saw, but I was amazed by the
things it could do. I and my brother decided to buy it, but my father
thought that would have been better to buy a C64. It was 1987. I've never
regretted his decision. I still remember my first original game I've ever
played: DeathWish 3 with awesome music by Ben Daglish.
This was the first happy moment of my life. The second happy moment
of my life was 8 years later, when i found SidPlay V1.23b in a BBS with a
little collection of music included... Until then I thought I was the
only fool who listened daily to C64 music, but I was not alone! :)

Warren is quite an authority on British software houses.  This has
lead him to send us quite a number of credit fixes in addition to
providing some interesting C64 music/game history.  Warren has
also provided tons of tunes, added several STIL entries, fixed
bad rips, and has contacted many composers for some proper
information as well as filtering out many a repeat.  Took over
from The Shark as main admin after Update #11 (sheesh, that
was four years ago now!).   

Comments
--------
For me, the SID chip was ahead of its time when launched into the 
C64 many years ago.  The original 6581 was simply a design for life,
and soon realised many great themes from the likes of Rob Hubbard and
Martin Galway.  What was more, most tunes didn't sound like 'chip' 
music at all, they were soundtracks for a generation of gaming.  If 
you look at most modern game developments, the backbone of C64 
musicians are still influencing computer gaming soundtracks today.  
In years to come may people listen to this collection and realise
how memorable C64 music really is.

C64 History (now condensed :)
-----------------------------
I first got a Commodore Plus/4 in 1985 and spent many a day using one.
However I really wanted a C64 and realised my dream in 1987.  Imagine
my shock when I heard Rob Hubbard's 'Thalamusik' (the Sanxion Loading
theme) for the first time.  It blew me away, and is still my favourite
C64 tune ever written.  In September 1988, my first C64 game
tips (for Stormbringer) were published in Zzap! 64. 
From then until late 1991 I contributed a stack of tips, listings and 
POKEs to Zzap! 64, sometimes under my nickname of "Waz".  Whilst
contributing, Robin Hogg who worked there also got me into writing
music hacks for games.  Later, I started to contribute numerous
tips and listings to Commodore Format (1991-1996). In 1991, I also
formed my 'group' Zaw Productions (even though it's mostly me) for
mainly writing C64 music.  I also helped Peter de Bie a fair bit with his 
ambitious 'Screens' collection, and in many ways this was a precursor
to what HVSC is now.  I've also had some music of mine in games, and
I still am writing C64 music as well as writing two regular articles for
'Commodore Zone' magazine and tracking down ex-Zzap! 64
reviewers for old times.  I'm also contributing to the last ever issue of
Zzap! 64 along with being a member of the C64 demo group Padua.

Inge has ripped several SIDs and represents the Amiga community quite
well.  As he notes below he plans to fixe a few SIDs so that they work
on _both_ PlaySID and SIDPlay (actually, he has already fixed a few).
Inge also holds the 'coveted' SID Hunt MVP award which was awarded to
the ripper who ripped the most SIDs from Lala's SID Hunt list.  I should
note that Inge almost wasn't accepted into the HVSC team due to his
Hubbard comment below...  ;)

Comments
--------
I was feeling most honoured when asked to be a part of this team.  Since
I got my C64 back in 1984, I have always felt a certain dragging towards
the wonderful music of the SID.  As I use both Amiga and PC nowadays, I
feel there is next to none of the modern tracker-tunes that have that
little extra like SIDmusic has.

C64 History
-----------
When some friends of mine got their C64's in 1983, I didn't stop bugging
my parents until I got one myself. That was in spring 1984. As so many
others, I started my C64-life by playing games. My first game was
Terminal Software's "Super Skramble", which also my parents enjoyed.
Some times later, Turbo Tape appeared at some friends, and soon we had
loads of tapes with games. Later I had to buy a disk drive.

I tried to learn basic during my first years, and in the end, I had made
several Font-editors and the likes. In 1986, I started to learn assembly,
and in 1987 I made lots of scrollers and crappy demos (You know, "demos"
which consisted of a picture and a scrolltext, and some music).

In August 1990 I bought an Amiga 500. Strangely enough, the years 1990-91
was my most productive years on the C64. ...until my old C64 broke down.
I got it fixed late in 1992, but soon it broke down again. In 1994 I bought
an A1200 which I am still using. In 1995 I bought another C64, and revived
some of my C64 skills. I made a parallel cable, and suddenly I could
transfer files back and forth between by C64 and Amiga. ...until I short-
circuited the cable (and also my C64) in October 1996. Since then, I have
done all my ripping in an emulator on Amiga. I have plans for repairing my
C64, so I can convert the music that won't run properly in the emulator.

The first real musical experience I had was when I heard the loader tune to
Daley Thompson's Decathlon (still one of my favourites).  Later, the Rambo
Loader tune really made my jaw drop down on my chest. From that moment, I
have been devoted to Martin Galway. Rob Hubbard has never really made it
past that level in my consciousness. That does not mean that I don't like
other composers too ;-)

Comments

It will come as no surprise when I say that SID music takes up a large
amount of my time. In fact, a day rarely goes by without Sidplay playing in
the background while I work. Ever since I made my first tape recording of SID
tunes, years ago, I've been comforted and amazed by the diversity of the
tunes and the SID chip in general. Especially when you consider the SID's
complexity compared to the sound capabilities of other 8-bit systems in
the eighties. 

C64 History
-----------
After a brief period with access to a ZX81-clone and a CP/M machine, I
finally got the thing I wanted: A C64. Some of my first games were
Phantoms of the Asteroid and Commando and even back then I knew there was
something special about the music in those games - in fact I bought
specific games (such as the not too exciting W.A.R) just because it had
music by Rob Hubbard. Now how's that for dedication? :-). As the C64
market dwindled, so did my interest in the C64. I kept my C64 on my desk,
but used it less and less. Then one day I bought a shareware CD that had
Sidplay v1.10 on it. I was ecstatic! - suddenly having the sound of the
C64 combined with the convenience (and storage capability) of the PC. I
didn't have any tunes but the four built-in ones, but it was enough to
keep me going until I found a 500kb pack of assorted tunes on another CD.
Soon after that, I got Internet access, which meant the newest Sidplay and
the NemeSIDs collection. However, the NemeSIDs collection was soon replaced 
with the High Voltage Sid Collection, due to its many advantages. Then 
after HVSC v2.0 was released I got in touch with LaLa and started submitting 
STIL entries. Following that, the HTML version of the STIL was born.

I'd just want to thank all the great C-64 composers for all the lovely
songs they made... I've spend countless hours listening to SIDs.

C64 History
-----------
I got my first C-64 in 1983. I was a member of several unknown groups
before I became a member of The Defiers in 1988. Between 1987 and 1991
I was mostly interested in the music, so I ripped all songs that
crossed my computer. I had around 10 disks with ripped music at that
time. I sold the C-64 (A sad day. I finished my last C-64 demo 2 minutes
before they took my computer.)  When I got my first C-64 emulator on
the Amiga, I started to rip again, and I was one of the contributors
for the NemeSIDs Collection.  Now I use my PC for ripping using CCS64.
Recently I bought a HardSID, which gives me the real C-64 sound again!

Just thanks to all those freaks writing emulators of old 8- and 16-bit
systems for PC. Without them, my life would most probably be a little blank
and boring. Go back to the 80's y'all!...

C64 History
-----------
I got my C64 in 1988, sold it in 1992. What interested me the most in it
was games and music, but I had been too young and unexperienced to compose
my own songs. However, after I had sold my breadbox, I decided to become a
musician - note that the C64 music was the main inspiration for that - and I
did so. I discovered the C64 again thanks to emulators in 1999. Since then,
I've been fulfiilling my childhood dreams by making sidmusic and taking part
in C64 scene life.

Back in 2000, Simon first started realising his dream of making a more
cycle accurate SID emulator that could facilitiate more accurate and
more C64 friendly playback of SID tunes.  Through development of the
libsidplay2 library used in most new SID emulators, he also fixed many
a bad rip for HVSC as well as helped invent the PSIDv2NG and RSID file
formats in use by HVSC today.  He shadowed the HVSC Team for some time
and helped them immensely with PSIDv2NG conversion, and his hard work
was rewarded with full membership of the Team in September 2002.

Stephan had ripped many tunes and contributed information to the HVSC
effort for the last two years plus.  His hard work and dedication in
ensuring that demo tunes were ripped correctly along with providing
quality STIL entries not only helped his efforts with his Demodungeon
website, but improved HVSC's quality also, and was rewarded with
membership of the HVSC Team in September 2002.  He still maintains
the Demodungeon site which is a useful place to go if you wish to find
which SID tunes appeared in which demo.

Comments
--------
I'm actually one of the few HVSC members that spends more time in the
/VARIOUS directory than with the major composers - and I mean *much* more!
Not that I dislike the classic game-tunes, not at all. My favourite game-
composer is Jeroen Tel - but for the same reason why I listen to so much
of the /VARIOUS composers: They managed to push the soundcapabilities of
the SID to - and sometimes seemingly over its limits while still main-
taining a high level of musical quality paired with skillful compositions.

C64 History
-----------
My first real memories to SID music are the MASH demo with Hubbard's
Sanxion and the Wanderer crackintro with Fred Gray's Hysteria, #3 playing.
I remember I could listen to these tunes virtually for hours.
Then I got into demos, fascinated by how they expanded the limits of the C64.
At about the same time I discovered the HVSC and found fun in locating all
the demotunes in the collection, however quite a few of them I couldn’t find.
So I requested *tons* of tunes at LaLa's Big SID Hunt before Warren Pilkington
and Peter Sandén taught me how to rip.

and all the sidtunes that appeared in the demos):

Being involved in some way with this SID collection means a lot to me. The
64 was part of me for a long time and listening to some of these tunes bring
back so many happy and fond memories of good times and friendship that I
have known through the C64 Scene since I started.

C64 History
-----------
I got my c64 back in 1986 and joined Hotline in 1987. Supplying, trading and
cracking. In 1990 me and XXX left Hotline and started our own group Talent,
later the same year we joined up with our Danish Friends in Ikari to form
the best co-op that ever lived. :) Ikari & Talent.

The author of Sidplay and the libsidplay Library, without which the
collection wouldn't probably be here.  As well as that, he:
Added a bunch of great tune fixes.  Helped find repeats in the
collection.  Helped with the proper identification of SID tunes.  Added to
and helped correct the musician list.  Added several ideas to help with the
collection.  Answered several questions about SIDPlay and SIDs in general.
Added several new tunes to the collection, and indeed wrote the current
source to the update tool.

I simply adore the SID (the MOS-6581), its sound capabilities and especially
the quality of the SID tunes. Imagine, those SIDs consist only out of three
voices (neglecting the virtual fourth channel for samples). In comparison,
most of the existing MODules from Amiga and PC, which use several hundred
kilobytes of high-quality samples, sound like crap ! Disgusting, isn't ?
Btw, I think the High Voltage SIDtune Collection will be the new standard
on the Net.

Has ripped several tunes and found SIDs from other collections
that weren't part of HVSC.  Provided a few corrected rips.  Helped
find some SID tune credits.  Found several errors in HVSC.

What an incredible sound chip! If you hear all the music in this
collection, then you know that most music composers are real artists.
They got the best out of the SID chip. They made special effects that
even today's normal synthesizers can't make. There were a lot of moments
that I turned on my C64 only for having some nice background music.
Happily there is now Sidplay...

C64 History
-----------
I got my first C64 in 1985. In 1987 I started with 3 other friends the group
Channel Four. My nickname was Fred. I made a lot of demos for this group. In
the beginning of 1989 a started making my own music routine. Unfortunately
it wasn't finished and I lost it. I sold my C64 with my whole demo
collection. A few years later I had many regrets that I sold all the
software with it. I bought a C64 again when I heard Sidplay 1.04 for DOS.
When I play the old C64 music on my PC, a lot of memories come back...

Jan provides HVSC with many a quality rip including many a requested
tune from the SID Hunt.   He also unearthed the whole truth about many
of the Magic Disk and Game On tunes by Thomas Detert as well as
providing useful credit and STIL information, and also has fixed many
tunes to be PlaySID compatible <understatement>.

After seeing a C64 first time, I fell in love with it. "Katakis"
was running and it was not only the perfect program or the astonishing
graphics, which made me shout for joy.  No, it was the great tunes,
including nice sound and great compositions, which impressed me. A new
period of time started for me and during the following years SID music
became an important part of my life. There is no doubt that that will
never change.
