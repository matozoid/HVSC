/20CC/Vlindertjes.sid
COMMENT: In a demo by Edwin van Santen, which he released about two years after
         the tune was made popular in the Papillion's crack intro, he states
         that he in fact composed the music. This demo contained a new version
         of the tune (/20CC/Vlindertjes_v2.sid). He explains how he had made
         the music two years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or
         something similar. While at a copyparty, someone stole his music disk
         which had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. About
         two months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro and no
         credit was given to van Santen.

/20CC/Words.sid
COMMENT: Inspired by Jeroen Tel's "Cybernoid II".

/Audial_Arts/Peters_Patrick/Lambada.sid
  TITLE: Lambada
 ARTIST: Kaoma
COMMENT: "I can tell you that the Lambada tune, used in our demo's/openings are
         from me. At that time I hadn't any player and I didn't want to spend
         too much time in making one. I ripped the 20CC player by analyzing the
         code in assembler. Then I programmed the codeblocks myself to get the
         Lambada tune right. I laughed when 20CC found out that their player
         was used and Falco Paul or Edwin van Santen hadn't made that tune
         earlier!!! They accused me of ripping routines etc. etc. Well.. they
         were right, I never claimed that it was my player but I merged my
         Lambada tune blocks via assembler into their old music blocks (I
         overwrote it). The funniest thing was that the Lambada tune from me
         was very populair at that time. When 20CC heard it they made their own
         Lambada tune, hehehehe..." (Patrick Peters)

COMMENT: This tune was ripped from the 1987 'pre-release', which was actually a
         theft-copy spread by FAC. Perhaps because it was really 'published' by
         a cracker, Magic Bytes decided to let the game 'sit' for a while, then
         releasing it under a different name in 1990 (whose new name was Cyber

### NEIL BRENNAN #############################################################

/Brennan_Neil/
COMMENT: The HVSC team via their sources have checked all the original credits
         and found that most of the tunes that were supposedly done by Greg
         Holland were in fact made by Neil Brennan. For most of the games Greg
         Holland was the graphic artist rather than the composer. The HVSC Crew
         also has confirmation of this fact from a senior employee of Beam
         Software, who was on Melbourne House's main programming team at the
         time.

  TITLE: Rubicon, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Jeroen Tel
COMMENT: "They wanted a title-theme for Shock Magazine, and gave me the first
         issue. There was a song in there, and I had no clue what it really
         was but thought it captured the feel of the entire magazine. So I
         simply made a cover of it, Danko style. I never had any hangups about
         having to do it all, music is all about sharing and developing ideas
         together in order to reach higher grounds. The chords aren't
         identical to Jeroen's version, in fact we had a little thing over
         that at a party in Oslo back in '94 or so. We hung over a keyboard
         and I played the chords my style, and he went like 'No! It's like
         THIS!' and I said 'Well, I want it THIS way!'. *grin* One of the guys
         at the party leaned over to me and whispered that he in fact
         preferred my version of the track. *smirk* Jeroen superimposed a sus2
         chord throughout the progression until it folds back to the tonic,
         where the sus2 becomes a m7. It's a nice move, one that I personally
         use quite a lot myself. But this time around I expanded the
         progression to plain chords following the bassline.
         After I had done the tune I found out that it was from Rubicon, but
         to me it doesn't matter.
         Later on I made a remix of it, called it Schizomix, with weird
         sounds. Because Rubicon had been a double-speed song, or something
         similar, I wanted to make weird and similar sounds but in a single-
         speed player. And that's all it was, a messed up version of my first
         cover so to speak." (TD)

         I send to every decade or so have liked this one (or what there is of

         side, sooooo i'm going to start it from scratch on newplayer 15 so I
         have better control over the vibrato and stuff. It's gonna be quite a

COMMENT: All comments for this file are by Georg Feil himself and are denoted
         by (GF).
         "I wrote it around '84 or '85 as a demo for my music editor called
         'Synth'. I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just
         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on
         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.
         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with
         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I
         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like
         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.
         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.
         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of
         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that
         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had
         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,
         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed
         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little
         program with launching my musical career..." (GF)

  TITLE: Stationary Ark
 ARTIST: John Mills-Cockell <?>
COMMENT: "Theme from Stationary Ark, a nature show on PBS. [...] It appears on
         Synth Sample as interpreted by a friend of mine. I didn't know what it
         was myself until I happened to see Stationary Ark one time. This song
         does not play properly on some C-64's where the SID chip filter is
         calibrated differently." (GF)

         While the the Amiga versions of Demonware's games The Power and Ooops
         Up had digitracks of the Snap songs, Detert was instructed NOT to do a
         cover of The Power by Snap for this soundtrack, obviously the guys at
         Snap meanwhile changed their minds about their agreement with
         Demonware.
         The C64 version of Ooops Up was never finished, early soundtrack
         versions done by Rodney Balai did feature a cover of the Snap song
         though. (see /Audial_Arts/Balai_Rodney/Ooops_Up.sid)

         he could use some help and I agreed to do some of the music. While the
         music and sfx was done in 1990, the game was put on ice by the
         Austrian guys as they became tired of it. Some years later they
         revived the project, finished it, and sold it to a German software
         house under the new name, "Hermetic"". (JCH)

COMMENT: This is just the first part of Queen's music.
         This one voice digi tune is a companion to the bizarre movie "Xmas
         Chortles" featuring Jason Mackenzie (Kenz) and friends in really manic
         scenes and behaviour, including setting fire to a Spectrum, re-making
         a Pepsi ad, lots of playing C64 Games and strange footage. The voice
         of Kenz is heard in the "Xmas Chortles" and "Merry Christmas" samples.
         According to Feekzoid, this tune was never supposed to be released.

         This is the very first published tune on the C64 that used samples.

         Arkanoid.)
         "Q: How did you get involved with using sampled sounds?
         MG: I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone
         else's code... OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package
         called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to
         include samples in a piece of music. [...] Never would I claim to have
         invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I
         couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that
         they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own
         drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that
         shipped in 'Arkanoid'. [...] After the project was in the shops I
         gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own
         custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a
         collage of farts & burps, don't you think? [...] Later I was able to
         acquire some proper drum samples and by 'Game Over' it got quite
         sophisticated." (MG)

         much just a cool tune to do. (It was a Georgio Moroder filler tune,
         whose style I had a lot of respect for as a producer). It was the
         first tune I did pulse-width sweeps on, but didn't get released 'til

         beginning of the tune. Too bad, eh?"
         "Well by the time I got to that game (1988) I was a bit hard up for
         ideas. I didn't know what to do with so few notes available! I wanted
         my tunes to build up into much larger entities but I always hit this
         limit. Plus the time at which that game was developed was a pretty
         rough time for Sensi, none of us were too happy at the time. Insects
         In Space was a victim of this. True though, it certainly has

/Galway_Martin/Miami_Vice.sid
COMMENT: "The Miami Vice game was a very quick job. I had been handed 'Miami
         Vice' and 'Highlander' because the outside development team working on
         it hadn't worked out who was going to do the sound (notice those games
         have little or no sound-effects), so I did my best in a very short
         time. I [...] picked 'The Chase' and the 'Main Theme' as the two tunes
         I would do. We had settled on two modes for the game - in your car and
         out of it I think. (Or maybe it was in the game and out of it, I can't
         remember.) I started on 'The Chase' and if you listen to the first few
         seconds of that you can hear the basis of that super-filter-echo tune
         that is so cool. I recall David Collier was sitting in the office with
         me while I was working on it. But while messing with it while everyone
         else was at lunch, I came across this cool sound. I added to it and
         added to it, and when we applied the non-sync'd filter sweep we both
         flipped out! I decided to abandon the conversion of that tune and
         simply go with the cool sounds I had stumbled upon. When the guys came
         back from lunch and listened to it they swore that there was a
         cassette deck connected somewhere and it wasn't the C64 playing it!
         Such a sound had not been heard before by any of us out of the C64. So
         I extended it and turned it into this tripping-out 11-minute piece.
         The main theme itself... I simply did my best with no drums (Rob
         Hubbard's strength). I think my strength with guitar solos helped pull
         it off. Both of those problematic games benefited from my music,
         actually, and the Ocean management were very relieved
         (understatement)." (MG)

/Galway_Martin/Ocean_Loader_1.sid
COMMENT: "The 'version 1' is a real tune, it was really like that on
         Hypersports and maybe one or two other games before Comic Bakery
         (Cyclone would have used it, for example, but it was never released by
         Ocean). The delay at 02:03.00 really is supposed to be a delay of 4
         beats." (MG)
         Because of the delay Martin mentioned at 2:03, it led a lot of people
         to believe later parts of the tune went out of synch and it was
         bugged. However, this has been confirmed as intentional. This version
         was known to have been used in Hyper Sports and Transformers.

/Galway_Martin/Ocean_Loader_2.sid
COMMENT: "'version 2' was a reworking of that tune that I did in late 1985 for
         Comic Bakery. There was actually supposed to be separate loading music
         for every game - that was my plan.  However, I was running out of time
         on projects and in the case of C.B. I simply reworked an older piece.
         After that I _really_ didn't have time to mess with it, and it stuck
         in universal use. Rambo was the only one that got its own loading
         music as part of this plan." (MG)
         This version was in use for many Ocean/Imagine games from late 1985 to
         mid 1987.

/Galway_Martin/Parallax.sid
COMMENT: Before starting on this game Galway bought Rendez-vous (by Jean Michel
         Jarre). He listened to it daily. His CD player broke 2 weeks later and
         didn't get repaired for 2 months, during which time Martin worked on
         Parallax, without realizing that Rendez-vous was unconsciously
         creeping into the music. He realized it only after he played the album
         again after the game was already shipped.
         "[Parallax] was 11 minutes long, certainly my longest at the time. I
         took my development gear home to work on it for a week or two. I just
         said to myself 'OK, it's going to be this mega-tune, so the intro has
         to be mega'. The intro took up two-thirds of the tune! I actually got
         bored with it, and stuck that silly melody on the end which doesn't
         really match. Going back I would have made it less melodic. I wanted
         to reflect the gigantic visual proportions represented by the parallax
         effect in the game so that's why it has an 'epic' feel."(MG)

         on holiday the next day or something. (Was it around September-1987?)
         The arcade game didn't have any music on the 'press start' screen, so
         it would have been a natural for an original tune. Maybe everyone
         regarded it as a 'baby game' which didn't merit much attention. CAN'T

         right from the beginning of the movie with all the robotic short notes

COMMENT: This is the song played under the credits at the end of the movie. It
         is also the theme song of "Number Five".

COMMENT: Covers arcade version except for tune #1.
         "I didn't have much memory space, I believe around 5 or 6K, so I was
         delighted to copy the arcade game exactly, which had very simple
         sound! That was my most accurate conversion." (MG)

  TITLE: If I Were a Rich Man [from the musical "Fiddler on the Roof"]
 ARTIST: Jerry Bock (music), Sheldon Harnick (lyrics)

/Galway_Martin/Terra_Cresta.sid
COMMENT: "I tried to create this feeling of a massive behemoth robot monster on
         its way to destroy you. Thus the marching beat and the minor chords
         and stark tones. I had to stick in the inevitable jamming solo towards
         the end of course. I was starting to face the glass ceiling imposed by
         the filter on the C64. While my particular SID sounded great, others
         were not like it at all and the solos were almost inaudible! At the
         other extreme the new C64C's were coming out and this filter
         unreliability had been fixed as part of a silicon revision. BUT the
         filters were way too open all the time and you could hardly hear any
         filtering! This caused the filtered note to come out a lot louder than
         it should have and 'stick out' rather unattractively. So I developed a
         'filter adjustment' parameter for my music program which would allow
         the customer to control this filter unreliability and get their
         particular machine to sound cool. But David Collier never put it in
         the options screen. (DOH!) There's always something wrong, eh?" (MG)

/Galway_Martin/Times_of_Lore.sid
COMMENT: "I remember I squeezed the code & data for 25 sound-effects into 923
         bytes - not bad, eh?" (MG)
(#1)
COMMENT: "The most complex original tune I did was the 'Times Of Lore' title
         tune, it took 20 days just to do the guitar solos! It has a random
         number generator which selects different guitar solos, but I didn't
         realise that people wouldn't leave it looping for its 11-minute
         duration so the work all got sort of wasted." (MG)

/Galway_Martin/Wizball.sid
(#2)
COMMENT: The opening bars of this tune are sampled by the group Console on
         their song "14 Zero Zero".
(#4)
COMMENT: "I was working at the Sensible Software office at the time of the
         major music creation, but the title screen music never got finished.
         When I returned to Ocean I got on with some other things, all the time
         worrying about this unfinished tune. Finally I slapped something on
         the end of it. I knew I could never top the first part, that's what
         the problem was. In my mind the second part of the tune is pretty lame
         compared with the first part. But for some people it represents the
         mysterious, magical, unconventional aspect of 'Wizball' so it fits in
         some ways. But you can tell it's not really like the other music in
         the game, which was primarily developed when I was with the Sensi
         boys, basking in that Sensi VIBE." (MG)
         "I really worked on the sound design of the voices a lot. The music
         seems to "flow" and "breathe" unlike anything before it." (MG)
(#5)
COMMENT: "Tune 5, the bonus screen tune, consists of several short riffs, and
         John Hare came up with the most musical ones on his bass guitar. I
         remember he would come up with the riffs, playing them over and over
         at full volume on his band's P.A. in their rented terraced house in
         Southend (not caring about what the neighbours thought!!!) - and while
         they went out to get me a "blow-out" burger at 3am, I would be
         transcribing it and enhancing it (a little)." (MG)
(#7)
COMMENT: "I composed the high-score music at Ocean after returning from
         Southend. Played it on the synth keyboard there. It's one of the few
         compositions of mine that I can actually play a decent rendition of on
         the piano." (MG)

COMMENT: "Chris Yates wrote the game over riff on his electric guitar. They
         were pretty impressed by the translation when they came back with my

  TITLE: Magnetic Fields, Part 4 [from Magnetic Fields]

/Galway_Martin/Yie_Ar_Kung_Fu_II.sid
COMMENT: "I just tried to come up with a crazy way of settling on a beginning
         note (my favourite beginning note of course, G - almost everything I
         do is in G). So I plugged in this echoing waveform thing and let it
         rip. The tune isn't particularly Chinese sounding, but I was working
         on producing that 'perfect melody', the one you'd be humming all day,
         you know. That was a phase I went through. [...] The sound I was
         converting from was itself a conversion of the arcade cabinet, which I
         have NEVER SEEN. It sounded like it was a lame conversion too, so I
         easily did a better sounding version. (The MSX's music only used two
         notes at once, for example.)" (MG)

/Gehrmann_Holger/Action_on_Protection.sid

         themes from 'Johann Sebastian Bach'." (HG)
(#1)
  TITLE: Badinerie [from Orchestral Suite No.2]
 ARTIST: Johann Sebastian Bach

/Gehrmann_Holger/Galactic_Meteors.sid
COMMENT: "One of the first machine language based songs I made on the C-64.
         'Soundcontrol' didn't have any fancy features at this time, so the
         songs aren't the greatest. Btw, I thought this game had never been
         released (since I never got any royalties)." (HG)
(#1)
  TITLE: Making Your Mind Up
 ARTIST: Bucks Fizz

/Gehrmann_Holger/Graffiti_Man.sid
COMMENT: "I didn't like the game, so this song for Rainbow Arts isn't my best
         one..." (HG)

/Gehrmann_Holger/Hollywood_Poker.sid
COMMENT: "I think this was the first song with the enhanced version of
         'Soundcontrol'. Now it was a sound programming language (SOPROL) where
         you could type in your songs like a basic program (with labels, sound
         commands and so on), and a compiler converted it to machine language.
         Unfortunately the compiled songs were running VERY slow because of the
         structure of the SOPROL language." (HG)

/Gehrmann_Holger/Input_64_Issue_03_85.sid
COMMENT: "For about 6 months I worked at Heise Verlag, and they had a radio
         commercial and wanted it to be converted to the C-64.
         I didn't have an assembler at that time, so I did it with a machine
         language monitor (same as with Galactic Meteors and AOP)." (HG)

/Gehrmann_Holger/North-Sea_Inferno.sid
COMMENT: "Magic Bytes asked me if I could help them with the game because the
         programmers left the company and went back to Denmark. I finished the
         Atari ST and Amiga version and did the C64 soundtrack. Btw, the
         programmers from Denmark released the game too, it was called 'Persian
         Gulf Inferno'. Magic Bytes sued them for doing this." (HG)
         "In the game credits there might be an 'alias name' (since I wasn't
         allowed to work for other companies at that time :-)" (HG)

/Gehrmann_Holger/Oil_Imperium.sid
COMMENT: "Karsten Obarski did some great songs for Oil Imperium Amiga, and it
         was my job to convert them to the C64 and IBM PC. My favorite is song

COMMENT: "[This and Operation Hongkong are] two adventure games I made. They
         were coded in a special 'adventure programming language' so I was able
         to convert them for the Atari ST within 2 days (without sound though).
         The Operation Hongkong song was done with a newer version of
         Soundcontrol." (HG)

         do this!). The song was credited to Spitting Image.

COMMENT: "There is an interesting story behind Commando. I went down to their
         office and started working on it late at night, and worked on it
         through the night. I took one listen to the original arcade version
         and started working on the c64 version. I think they wanted some
         resemblance to the arcade version, but I just did what I wanted to do.
         By the time everyone arrived at 8.00am in the morning, I had loaded
         the main tune on every C64 in the building! I got my cheque and was on
         a train home by 10.00 am..." (RH)

/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid
COMMENT: "[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music was Gary Liddon's idea.
         [...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told Rob Hubbard
         to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side of the Moon
         by Pink Floyd." (Info from Matt Furniss.)
         "The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and Romeo/Juliet
         music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such as end of
         level, extra life etc..."
         "Delta was based on this minimalist composition technique inspired by
         Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard to do and required
         some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was tedious to
         debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite liked the
         other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week period....." (RH)
         According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
         to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
         insane.

         also used for an ST game (GoldRunner I think). I only used 2 SID
         voices for all these tunes because I used the other for SFX...... Most
         of the tunes were sketched out on a small keyboard and manuscript
         paper. I used paper to keep track of the basic ideas and arrangement,
         and I still have all the original manuscripts. A lot of the
         manuscripts are not readable because I used to work very fast and
         never updated many of the changes I made. I used to use a machine code
         monitor to edit music data and sound patch data on the file while the
         tune was playing. This allowed me to really fine tune the SID

         time ran out and they couldn't wait the extra three weeks to finish
         off the music and implement it the way I wanted. So I hacked and

         The Last V8 was the first game released by Mastertronic's new label
         MAD (Mastertronic's Added Dimension). Due to the fact they wanted the

         released and therefore unfortunately had a bug, where the
         main theme music (subtune #1) falls out of synch at around the one
         minute mark.  Upon closer investigation, this is due to a mere seven
         bytes of the music player code being incorrect.  This SID has those

/Hubbard_Rob/Thrust.sid
COMMENT: Review copies of this game had a bugged loader which mucked up the
         music and so reviewers of the game gave the music a much lower rating.
         Julian Rignall (ex-editor of Zzap! 64) takes up the story:
         "I remember the God awful cacophony that was our review copy of
         Thrust's music as though it were still playing. This was the problem:
         the drum sounds worked, but all the other instrument sounds were
         screwed - basically it resulted in this horrible screeching noise
         playing to drums, rather than the cool heavyish sound that was heard
         in the final version of the game. It sounded really harsh and so it
         was duly shot down by us in the review. I remember hearing the
         'proper' version of the game at a later dater and thinking 'ooooops!'.
         After all it was a classic tune (it became one of my faves, indeed)
         and we'd mercilessly beaten it down in the review, which was totally
         unfair. Still, it was good to be able to do a ZZAPback on it and
         remedy the error."

COMMENT: This is claimed to be the first ever C64 music made using samples.
         According to Hülsbeck, though, the game "Bad Cat" was delayed about 3
         months at Rainbow Arts during which time Imagine released their game
         "Arkanoid", containing Martin Galway's sample-like technique.
         "Arkanoid" thus became the first publically available game to feature
         SID music with samples.

         hated R'n'R. Therefore, Ramiro composed part of the Circus Attractions

/Huelsbeck_Chris/R-type.sid
COMMENT: Very interesting story here. Katakis was released in September 1988 by
         Rainbow Arts, however it never got a release in the UK as Activision
         had it cancelled because of similarities to R-type, to which
         Activision had bought the conversion rights. Activision were getting
         nowhere with their conversion of R-Type and they liked what they saw
         of Katakis, so they hired the same programming team (Manfred Trenz and
         others) to do the C64 conversion. They only got 6 weeks to write the
         conversion, and sadly, it shows. Katakis was eventually altered and
         released as Denaris in 1989. Tunes #2 to #14 all cover of the arcade
         game.

         This was the first time I ever did this.
         Composed in JCH player v3.

/JCH/42nd_Street.sid
COMMENT: A very weird tune with a very weird ending. After I named the tune
         "42nd Street" I played it in a driver on the C64 which could display

/JCH/Cotune_2.sid

         had been away from the C64 for months, playing around with the PC -
         however, a guy in "Pretzel Logic" said he needed a crowdnoise effect,

/JCH/Double_speed.sid
COMMENT: This is the only quickspeed tune not made in v17.Q0. It was made in
         1989, some time before Jeroen Tel made his first quatro-tune for
         "Invest". However, the idea was not new at that time. In the
         mid-eighties Tony Crowther experimented with quatro players in games
         such as "Zig Zag". My double speed tune, however, used the ordinary v9
         player and was simply called twice a frame.

/JCH/Easy_does_it.sid
COMMENT: Notice how I put real synthesizer chords into the digi voice. That was
         not done very often on the Commodore 64 - musicians normally used this

         modulation effects and was used in a "Pretzel Logic" demo.

         George Carl during his shows. Here I tried to emulate a real mouth
         organ using ring modulation.
         Composed in JCH player v13.

/JCH/Glider_Pilot.sid
COMMENT: This was a conversion from an old C64 game of the same name. The
         composition was very nice but used horribly raw sounds. I converted

         was changed to make SilverRock happy. As you can hear, the difference
         is really not that big. Later on during the programming of the game,
         Thomas (the programmer) realized that he could not fit all the
         leveltunes into the game, hence this leveltune was the first to go.

/JCH/Hawaii.sid
COMMENT: A very long tune containing one of the longest solo parts I have ever
         done in a C64 tune. The bassline and drums were originally made by
         Morten Sigaard Kristensen, but in the end I "raped" it so much that it
         virtually became my own work. The solo part starts at 01:39. Notice
         how the tune decays in the end - this was very unusual on the C64.

/JCH/Heavy_Hit.sid

/JCH/Hexagon_Party.sid
COMMENT: Made FOR that party, not AT it. The tune contains quite a lot of
         harmonic mistakes, something I often made in that period. These were
         often caused by "lazy" transpositions of the bassline sequence -
         instead of creating a new one.

/JCH/Labyrint.sid
COMMENT: A television quiz program which was made popular by a great Danish
         former disc-jockey Kim Schumacher was converted by a small Danish firm
         as a C64 game. The music was composed on the Amiga by an unknown guy.
         "DRAX" was asked to convert the tune for a certain sum of money but,
         as he said himself, he wasn't sure he could convert it so he asked me
         for help. I completed the conversion for the ridiculous sum of money.
         Later, "DRAX" admitted that he didn't complete the conversion because
         he thought the original Amiga music was boring. I must confess that he
         has a point there.

         for "Pit Fighter". It was probably in 1991 - I remember I made an
         extra effort out of squeezing as many chords and effects into the two
         voices of the ingame tune as I could, to make it sound like many more

         soon became enormously popular. During the success of the troll, a
         real musician produced a CD containing a rap hit where Hugo was
         singing using the typical voice which was also used in the game. As
         the game was converted for sales versions from the Amiga to PC and

         hear loads of harmonic errors here and there. The game was done for a
         sideways shoot'em up which a couple of totally unknown danish guys was
         making. They soon lost all interest in their game, however. The
         hiscore theme was a conversion of the old Cliff Richard hit
         "Congratulations" done right out my head. I always wanted to make such
         a hiscore tune, because I always thought Rob Hubbard did it all wrong
         when he made "sad" hiscore tunes. It is a sad thing when the game
         ends, but getting a high score is supposed to be a GOOD thing! :)

         unlocks the noise in such a way that the noise waveform sounds more
         metallic. However, I later discovered that this worked differently
         from C64 to C64. On some C64, I had to lock the waveform with $F0,
         where other versions required $F8 to achieve the same effect.

         with it myself. Anyways, I had sent disks with a load of tunes on to
         all the major software companies at the time. Firebird contacted me,
         they wanted to use Icups. I told them at the time that it was kind of
         a rip off of Bogg's Detergent, but they were quite happy to offer to
         buy it. They offered me 150 pounds, and then when someone pointed out
         again to them that it was based on Bogg's tune, they gave him half the

         cancelled.

         home it sounded like crap... Typical... Since then I've never composed
         anything at a party. BTW, I composed it for the intro of Lethal

         This is probably one of my most used tunes. Back in 1990, when it was
         made, I think it got used in 3 or 4 demos. The tune was composed
         immediately after listening to a Charles Deenen tune for some

         Ahh... Mot many liked this tune I guess. I didn't get much response to

         Sitting at my synth I came up with these chords, and thinking

         this tune. It's fairly simply, but then again so is all house-music.
         It has a catchy theme though I think. Lion/Chromance used this for the
         intro for Domination #8. The tune was supposed to be exclusive, but
         then suddenly out of the blue an old AVT-project called 'Icarus'
         surfaced, and as my tune was first intended for that production I was

COMMENT: "Made with JCH Newplayer v20.
         I made this tune in December 1991 especially for the upcoming Lethal

         just started his software label called Imagination Developments. So,
         at The Party 1 in 1991 he got the finished tune and plugged it into

         that he did a 90% copy of it. He explained to me later on, that he did
         it to gain experience, which is OK my me, but unfortunately it got

/Ouwehand_Reyn/Audio_Art.sid
COMMENT: "I believe I made this tune for a mag called Magna Magazine. A lot of

         Armalyte for Thalamus. Also used in the cartridge versio of Myth, in
         addition to the original Myth music.
         "System 3 asked me to make music for Deadlock, but the game was never
         finished - maybe they never even started. I never got any money for
         this. And I didn't know it was used in the cartridge version of

         (20CC), who lived in the neighbourhood that time fixed all the sounds.

         Donk (the author of Flimbo's Quest) didn't like it." (RO) So they used

/Ouwehand_Reyn/Last_Ninja_3.sid
(#3)
COMMENT: The tune falls out of synch at around 4:50, which is when the tune
         should loop. However, this is due to the music data in the game
         behaving exactly the same way. You would never get to hear this part
         of the tune in the game, as the intro would finish and load the first
         level before the music got to that point.
         "I guess I had some time pressure... I knew it would fade away
         anyhow... never thought about that fact that people in 2000 would
         listen to it with SIDPlay.... :)" (RO)

COMMENT: "Alien 3 was the most difficult project I worked on - but I loved
         doing it. Probe sent me an audio cassette of the Sega Genesis version
         to convert to the C64. Naturally, I was only allowed the bare minimum
         of free memory, so I had to chuck out all the effects modules in my
         music player to make room for the data (even vibrato had to go). The

         more likely to listen to John Cage or Pierre Henry, so I wasn't really
         sure how to write it. SoedeSoft editor again. Horrible drums again,
         the snare being a bit like the one in Thalamusic." (BH)

   NAME: Bass Drummed Out and Filter Frantic
COMMENT: "Just another meaningless bit of computer composition - trying out
         different drum and bass line effects, reall, but it's got a bit of
         kick to it. System 6581 editor." (BH)

/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Bogey_Boogie.sid
COMMENT: "Written at the same time as the Acid... tunes, but used in something
         else. (Quantum Designs' "Music Bars" demo) Again, just an experiment
         in sound, rather than a tune as such. SoedeSoft editor." (BH)

/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Feedback_Experiment.sid
COMMENT: "This tune does exactly what it says on the box, basically trying to
         get a ring-mod effect that sounded like an electric guitar being left
         leaning on a Marshall amplifier turned up to 11. I was fairly pleased
         with the result, it sounds quite uncomfortable on headphones. The tune
         was written on a SoedeSoft editor, which explains the rather fuzzy
         triggering and messy drum sounds, but gliding and filter control was
         much more versatile than anything else around at the time, I felt, and
         you could sustain notes for about 5 hours. The tune was not written
         especially for the "Acid At The PC Show" demo, having being composed
         around 8 weeks earlier, but Shane (coder) wanted to use them." (BH)

         in London (hence the demo title). Has a long ending after a drum solo
         that John Bonham would probably laugh at. I also did a version of this
         tune in Ubiks Music in 1988, which was even worse. I hope that's never

         meant to be released but we ended up sticking in on an SG demo disk
         anyway. Note that one of the arpeggios is a bit wonky, and I couldn't
         be bothered to do the start of the piece, but I felt that it was a
         pretty good sound-a-like." (BH)

COMMENT: "Another day, another pointless budget game. Yogi Bear deserved
         better! I can't remember if I composed the tune or if it was a
         conversion of some Atari ST music, written by some bloke who's name I
         can't remember. We used to do a few conversions back then. These were
         great fun to do. The software company would sent Gerard Gourley a copy
         of the original music, usually recorded on a cassette recorder sitting
         by the TV. He'd then play the tune down the telephone to me, and I'd
         record it on another cassette from the telephone's earpiece. The
         resulting hi-fidelity master recording would then be my basis. I
         usually had to guess at the basslines, as they'd become totally
         inaudible on the tape. Then I'd U-U the result back to Gerard within 2
         hours, and if I was lucky I'd get £100 about 6 months later after the
         'middle man' had taken his bit. Or half that if the tune was for

COMMENT: "Composed for another dodgy budget game, in the old SG editor I think,
         which was written by Andy Lumley. I probably had about 12 hours notice
         to write this... Zzap reviewed it and called it siren 'music', so they
         can't have listened to more than about 10 seconds of it. I quite liked
         it at the time, but more for the effects than the rather scrappy lead
         lines. Tune 4 was totally different in style, for the hiscore table.
         The main tune seems to be bugged near the end - this must have
         happened when the file was inserted into the game, it was OK when it
         left me. To be honest, music for this sort of game was an afterthought
         - and for the money I was getting, I wasn't about to try and write an
         epic!" (BH)

         His most notorious use of this was a Dutch TV programme called 'Pisa'
         (filmed from the leaning tower) with Harry saying his 'Koud He?'
         catchphrase to everyone that went by. Probe Software then heard the
         tune and asked Jeroen if he'd change the samples, and lo and behold it
         became the Savage theme.
         "Some background info. The 'KOUD HE' sample is from a Dutch comedian
         called 'Harry Vermeegen'. It was like a hype saying. I found it a nice
         sample to play around with. A spontanious tune I did just 4 fun." (JT)

         Although these tunes were used on 'Mega Phoenix' as well, they were
         used in this game first. Like Army Moves, it was a two part game. The
         reason for the Hawaiian style of music in tune #2 is that the end
         sequence displayed your character on a Hawaiian beach type scene
         complete with a bit of text.

COMMENT: " 'Nighthunter' voice is me. The 'laughing' and the 'Allright!' is ME
         and my BROTHER, just before we're about to hit town. That explain the
         silly 'BURP!' and 'AJIIRK' too. My brother was pushing me to go with
         him, so I asked him to sample some voices real fast. (in this case,
         rather silly ones.) This is probably the most 'rushed' music I've ever
         made. (which shows somehow). I like many of the ideas in it, but I
         just had to meet the deadline. No time for quality checks... just...
         PRODUCE and DELIVER. Too bad somehow. It give us a funny compilation
         of brainactivity though :O
         BTW: If you want to know my brother's name: It's 'Kees Tel' (he's an
         awesome composer and musician. He composes almost any imaginable style
         of music and plays a LOT of instruments.)" (All comments by JT.)

COMMENT: "To make a complex story short: BEFORE I had to make the 'TURBO

         EUROPE was never finished (at least not the first version). I don't
         know why/when/where/how.
         Then Turbo Outrun was made. (you know the music, etc.) One of the two
         title-tunes (not the 1.2.3. hit-it! one) was actually composed for
         Outrun Europe.
         OUTRUN EUROPA in 1990 is a totally different game from the old
         unfinished, never released game in 1988/1989." (All comments from JT)

COMMENT: These three tunes were prototypes for a US Gold/Probe game 'Outrun
         Europe'. However, the game was never completed and the programming
         team involved went on to do Turbo Outrun instead. This was also a
         different game from Outrun Europa, released in 1991. The first two
         tunes cover the arcade version.

COMMENT: All those weird references to snakes (eg the HZ demo "Snake or Die")
         comes from strange Horizon rituals. At the HZ party in Vårby 1989 the
         HZ members were not only dressed in training suits with HZ logotypes,
         they also brought rubber snakes bought from the closest toy store,
         which they used to whip visitors and each other with. (Spank! Spank!)

         tune, it's not my style ya know, but I felt like doing a tune like
         this because lots a people like it. Therefore I added sum of my music
         style to the tune, that's why it sounds a bit techno like.. Try to
         enjoy this tune with a stereo, you'll like it I guess.. By the way
         remember that all C128 computers have a different filter set on their
         sid chips,so the music sounds a bit different than on normal c64
         computers, you'll hear the difference on the bass, the filters doesn't
         open theirselves so much on C128! But who the fuck cares, this music
         runs on all computers, that's what counts! [...]"

COMMENT: Due to many complaints about the voting system done at competition
         parties (mainly PC users voting for the C64 competition), Greatrix
         decided to enter the competition with a deliberate pathetic tune. His
         goal was to see if his dismal creation could score higher than some of
         the real competitors proving the system was a complete farce. For this
         particular competition, SymMek98, Greatrix's tune rightfully finished
         last.

         "I practiced a lot making sids in the late 1980s but released my
         first tunes in 1990.  After Antti Kangas (Scorpion) finished
         his first music routine for Artline Designs (ALD) we started to
         release "quality-sounds".  Before ALD I was the founder member of
         Contex.  All tunes were composed with an assembler.  Reach me via
         anttihan@hotmail.com" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Artlight_Zone.sid
  TITLE: The Twilight Zone [from the TV series]
 ARTIST: Lalo Schifrin
COMMENT: "My first 'good' song with ALD-player v2.1 and one of the few covers I
         ever did. V2.1 didn't have any pulse data for $41 sounds so therefore
         I just used $11 or $21 to have acceptable melody-sounds.
         I was just playing around with the routine and somehow the Zone-theme
         appeared into my mind, but it's only influenced by the theme and the
         rest of the tune was just an effort of imagination.
         Done in January/February 1990." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/ATA.sid
COMMENT: "Released in 1992, made with ALD-player v3.0 which was developed late
         1990. The routine turned out to be the one I used most, though v3.7
         was even ready at the time.
         The tune itself was the first one I was asked to do for a game. ATA
         was a Tetris-clone done by German Lower Level and I don't recall if I
         got paid for the track, but anyway it was liked by the authors and
         apparently many others.
         This must have been the best track I've done if I don't take count on
         my new tunes. I wasn't anymore much into composing that time, I just
         composed as a time-killer. Also a high score track was included." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/B-Ball.sid
COMMENT: "The B-Ball sounds were ordered in the Autumn 92 just after I had
         released my second music-collection which apparently didn't get spread
         much as I sent it to my old pals, which I even didn't know if they
         were in the scene anymore or not. The B-Ball track however, never got
         released as the game wasn't sold (I guess). I liked this track a lot
         myself and in fact it was the first time I had to do jingles. The
         player I used was v3.6. B-Ball was the last (finished) track I did
         until now in 1999." (AH)

         participated in Proxy 99 party in Finland, even though I wasn't
         present it won the C64 music competition. Some people were really
         amazed to see a track from me for a long long time. I made the basis
         for it with Fasttracker and this is the way I compose the tunes these
         days. It's not a hard job to 'convert' the into assembler if you just
         make the tunes in a 64-style." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Compact.sid
COMMENT: "Yet another one done in April 1999. I fixed this one just after
         Beyond Grave, but this one I did with the old style - just playing
         around with the routine. Later on I discovered that the arpeggios
         turned out to be much like in Hawkeye by Jeroen Tel. I intended to do
         a slow tune and this is what came out of my head." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Conflex.sid
COMMENT: "Done in 1990 with v3.0 and was released in my Music Pack #1.
         Nothing special there though I remember I liked it very much back in
         1990. Somehow the "wind-effect" turned out to be in many of my tunes,
         including this one as well. The name comes from Con(tex) and Flex."

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Discoland.sid
COMMENT: "I composed this one with Fasttracker II and of course with c64
         sounds. This time transforming the .xm into our c64 music-routine
         turned out to be quite tricky (maybe I just wasn`t in the mood)...
         Anyway, I like the melody and I say that`s the most important element
         in a sid tune." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Drivers_Dog.sid
COMMENT: "The name comes from Shell`s hot dog which I often eat when coming
         home from my DJ gigs. Quite funky tune and I`m quite pleased with the
         "2nd part" of the song. Uses player v3.7 which was the last ALD-player
         and is the only one which offers you the chance to put bassdrum into
         bass-sound." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/FanFarewell.sid
COMMENT: "V2.8 production which was a huge step in sounds compared to v2.1 or
         v2.4. I made several tunes with this player back in 1990. The tune
         itself is just a fanfare as you can hear, you could say that this was

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Feelin_Blue.sid
COMMENT: "Was actually my first released tune and used in the last Contex demo
         called "Handjob Lotion" released May 1990. Used player v2.1 and you
         can hear it from the $21 melody sound. I remember Zardax/Origo played
         this melody in the air pretending there was a keyboard under his
         fingers and asked me what is the song he's playing.. of course I knew
         it!" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Frazze.sid
COMMENT: "Also in "Handjob Lotion" and done with v2.1 as well. This time I used

         in a Talent-intro and in Royal Writer. Someone's been liking it." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Frequency_69.sid
COMMENT: "Done somewhere around late 1991 and released 1992. This was my effort
         to do a techno-track. Uses $15 or $17 ring modulation, $11 bass-drum
         and $11 bass which is played low. I just loved using low frequency
         bass (LFO/LFO) and the tune was inspired by a band called Rhythmatic.
         Scrap/Genesis Project (ex-Contex) reviewed this tune and commented 'Is

COMMENT: "This one was meant to be a jamming intro-tune, nothing else. I

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Mello-D_Pop.sid
COMMENT: "I can recall quite clearly that I designed the arpeggios with my
         synthesizer and that was all I needed. I also used to create the
         melodies by playing the bass and chorus from C64 and the melody from
         the synth, it was quite easy. However, I should have done longer
         melodies, too often the melody lasted for 16 beats and then I just
         repeated it." (AH)

COMMENT: "The intro music for "The Return of A" - my music collection #2.
         The first time I used $11 in arpeggios. I think this tune got its
         right atmosphere right from the beginning. The pulse bassdrum was
         meant to be as a heartbeat, oooh I loved the bass-sound. So simple so
         cool!" (AH)

         make use of pulse width modification.
         For the 'zero page version' of this piece, I had cut down the player
         to almost nothing in order to get a real short file with as little
         raster time as possible. During that step, I removed the routine for
         the pulse modification and increased the detuning of voice #2 and #3

         make the instruments sound the nearest possible to the original and I
         was quite successful (also because I ripped the trumpet sound from
         some DOS/ADSR tune - check /VARIOUS/A-F/ADSR/DOS/Pursuit.sid).

COMMENT: "Made for the font collection in Unreal's tooldisk 'Tooltime'. My
         first original tune (not a cover) on C64 (November 95). Tooltime was
         full of this tune - it was used in nearly all notes on the disk
         because we didn't have any other tunes to use and we didn't want to
         use the ripped ones." (ZE)

  TITLE: Mountain Bike Racer, Tune #1

COMMENT: This was my first C64 tune made in October 95 and also the first

         version, since I had an 800XE before C64. Anyway the C64 version is
         nearly the same. Maybe if I had known that Adam Gilmore made it
         also on C64, I wouldn't have covered it." (ZE)

/VARIOUS/M-R/PseudoGrafx/Partyzak.sid
COMMENT: "IMHO my worst tune because I was absolutely out of inspiration when
         doing it. I had to finish it during one afternoon since it was a
         tune for our partyreport which was held on one weekend in spring 96
         - and I also had to make a picture for that report on the same day. My
         first tune made in an improved version of TFX - v1.3." (ZE)

         an easy work to rewrite it (he recorded the module for me on a tape
         since I didn't have PC yet) - it took me only 1 day and it's nearly
         the same as the original. Made in February 1997. Sounds the best on
         a real C64." (ZE)

         in Rockmonitor 2/3 by OPM/Dutch USA-Team, which is a modified version

         generally this can be heard in the tune. Again I try to make some

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Apolloguys.sid
COMMENT: "One of my personal favourites, despite the fact that I used it in an
         apology demo to Zetrex 2005. My good friends Wizz & Kaze demanded me
         to do this demo in order to stop the war. To compensate for my loss of
         face, I filled the screen with my name in sprites, dancing around so
         that you only would remember 2 things after having seen the demo: the
         music and the name RAMBONES. :) What a hoax, Kaze got his software
         from me, and me and TSN visited Wizz every weekend. There's some

         sort of telling a story - that's why the lead is so variable. Actually

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/First_Rockmon_PSID.sid

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Guitar_Flan.sid
COMMENT: "Get this over into your C64 now! :) I thought that Tim Follin's
         guitar in Led Storm was too good, and wondered how the hell he did it.
         So, after working for hours, I found some good sounds and was lucky
         with the filter. This guitar really sounds like a distorted guitar!
         and no samples." (JH)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/I_Like_Choroid.sid
COMMENT: "That's exactly what I did, and I still do. He made some cool sounds,
         and of course I ripped them. I've been searching for you Jonathan for
         like say 8 years, where did you go ? :) I originally put Martin
         Galway's 'Game Over' drums on this tune, but I couldn't convert the
         sampleroutine, and now I don't care, course it was quite noisy anyway.
         :) Just to remind you, try looking in your Choroid dir - and load
         'Choroid's Back!'." (JH)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Indian_Walk.sid
COMMENT: "My 2nd or 3rd tune. It's supposed to sound like it's called :) really
         CRAZY sounds, and I like it! It was missing for several years, because

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Jarre_Dreams_PSID.sid
COMMENT: "Well, not much Jarre here, but that's the way it goes... This is a
         typical 'Rambones' synth violin yawn yawn long melody. The (in)famous
         sound I refer to was originally ripped from MAD'69 's 'Mixable' demo
         from Scoop. I got stuck with this sound, probably because I played the
         violin for real, and I just couldn't shake it off. :) Again, I
         compensated in the demo, by splatting my name all over the screen."
         (JH)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Like_Galway.sid
COMMENT: "Many have tried, and tried, to imitate Martin's wonderful phasing and
         trance sounds, and we have all failed miserably. :) Anyway, this is
         one of my favourites also, It simply has a bit of atmosphere, maybe
         even a touch of Wizball (which was the general idea). This really
         needs filter! At this point, I had splatted my name all over so many
         demos, that people began to think there was a group called 'The
         Rambones'... I had to write a looong scrolltext, with this music in
         the background, slaying the 'lamers'. :)" (JH)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Maybe_Its_Final.sid

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Mixed_Emotions_PSID.sid
COMMENT: "That's exactly what my emotions were as I used this tune in my last
         demo, on the last screen. It was the Dexion-party in 1988. I had
         released Apolloguys the same day, and I had bought my Amiga 500 only 2
         weeks before coming to this party. The first screen featured 'Like
         Galway', and me writing a lot of text about who and what 'Rambones'
         was. The middle screen was the 'Amiga Noid' screen, with a small
         picture of an Amiga, and a scroll telling that TST would soon rule it.
         The last one, with this music, was a 10 point list of things about the
         C64 that bored the hell out of me. Things like colorbars, sprites
         moving in sinus, Hubbard alike drums/routines, all with the same sound
         and generally everything that was in at that time. For me it was sad
         to see a large variety of composers using more or less the same
         routine, leaving the music in a grey state. I admire the sound of Fred
         Gray, Martin Galway, Rob Hubbard, David Whittaker, Ben Daglish and
         Anthony Crowther, and any other programmer that built it all up from
         scratch." (JH)

COMMENT: "The seed had been planted. After releasing my first music-dedicated

         day long. My newfound inspiration: SLL .. :) After having made my
         first few Soundtracker-modules, I sent a demo with some musics and a
         picture to Hewson. They replied: your music is quite good, but we
         cannot accept you as a graphics-artist, the picture lacks all kind of

         One of my good contacts, and a very musical one to was Banana/The
         Electronic Knights. He had already made more than 30 tunes when I
         first laid my hands on Soundmon. I didn't know at all how to use this
         program, but I could hear from Chris' and Banana's music that it
         definitely was the way to go. So I asked Banana for some help. He sent
         me more than 10 handwritten pages, how to type in this bass and use
         the program. So, it was my first tune ever. As on any occasion:
         Banana, if you see this, write to me!" (JH)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Rambones/Ode_To_Laxity.sid
COMMENT: "Well, I met Laxity the first time when he visited Wizz, to code some

         player. In a transition period he had doing this, he tried
         Soundmonitor, and, not to my surprise, of course he was much better
         than I. So, what do you do ? Of course, another 'Ode to...' :) I kinda
         like this, as did he, but there's hardly any bass in it, because I try
         (again) to make some drums.,, One more thing: the sounds were made by
         Laxity. :)" (JH)

         I didn't just rip it. I started on several tunes at the same time, to
         try and get them all to sound as they came from one whole, like Mike
         Oldfield does. This was the first one, but I never finished ZM4, I was

         that I use all 3 voices for melody and no stupid drums. It almost
         sounds as if I designed the tune? No I didn't, almost anything just

         made in less than half an hour, then I had to go on to another friend.
         I was so busy, driving around on my moped, dumping demos/games, and
         then on to the next. Finally, every evening, I would end up at TSN's

         "This was a desperate attempt of doing a cover of the Tusker_Intro

         bugged, and fell out of synch when looping. This isn't ANYTHING close
         to the original version, but... the reason why this one didn't get a

COMMENT: "These tunes were originally meant for a game I had in mind, but I
         never got any further than composing the music and I think maybe I had
         the titlescreen of the game coded ;) (whereof the ingame-tune sucks
         and Game Over-tunes and Get Ready-tunes are heavily, HEAVILY inspired
         by other tunes). This tune has never been spread, and it's if I
         remember correctly now, the last C-64 tune I ever made." (TS)

COMMENT: "This is a cover of a tune by a Norwegian artist called Sputnik. He is
         a truck-driver, and sings in his spare-time. And he's actually not
         singing 100% clean, and YET he's been releasing HEAPS of albums.
         Mostly bought by really old people. The title translated to English,
         would be something like "Divorcing Johanne". And not surprisingly, the
         tune is about a man who wants to get divorced ;) I do NOT listen to
         such music, the inspiration came from a techno-version of this made on
         Amiga back in 94 I think. :)" (TRS)

COMMENT: "Walker's Warbles" was a Martin Walker music demo which came as a free
         giveaway with the disk version of "Armalyte" by Thalamus (which MW did
         the music for.) Tune 3 is an early version of what would eventually be
         used in the game "Dominion" bundled on a Zzap! 64 covertape in 1990,
         and tune 4 is an early version of the "Aggressor Theme". The final
         version of this (and the one which Revolution uses) is the one on MW's
         "Zzap! 64 Music Demo" which appeared on Zzap 64's June 1989 covermount
         cassette. (Comment by Warren Pilkington)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/
COMMENT: All comments by Joachim Wijnhoven are marked with (JW).

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Action_Biker_Remix.sid
  TITLE: Action Biker, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Rob Hubbard
COMMENT: "This is a remix from Rob Hubbard's Action Biker main theme (#1) from
         the year 1985! (c) Mastertronic. Listen to the original and hear the
         difference! I first typed over the notes (bass + lead) from a Music
         Assembler example tune. Not using the ugly percussion track. The
         chords are typed over from a Midi file called Biker. (Lazy me eh?!).
         Maybe this will not be necessary in future because there is a Midi to
         Mod program and buddy Roland Hermans has made a Mod to Sid program.
         I'm not quite happy with this tune because of the weak 2 notes
         arpeggio part (from 1:14 to 1:50). I made the volume of this arpeggio
         part a bit softer so it becomes a bit less annoying. Maybe I will
         improve this tune sometime. Same presets used as in Rolfie Title
         Remix. Typing over the notes took some amount of time (I always work
         slowly!). I used too many sequences in the 2nd track (it can only
         handle 128). So Roland Hermans "packed" several sequences into only a
         few so the player can handle them. This is the 2nd tune for mainly
         Polish based group Axelerate. Tune is played at CIA 1 Timer A (PAL)
         because we wanted another speed than a normal one. Tune has nice
         ending, don't you agree? Hope you like it!" (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Als_de_sterre.sid
   NAME: Als de sterre dao baove straole
COMMENT: "The demo in which this sound was spread contained the full lyrics of
         the song written in South Dutch dialect. This tune consists of a
         double lead to get a sort of echo effect. The reason why I made this
         song: In the south of Holland we celibrate Carnival each year around
         the end of February and because I live in a provence of Southern
         Holland called Limburg I decided to make one of the best Carnival
         songs on the C64! During Carnival everyone dresses up in some strange
         costume and goes into pubs to party and of course drink a lot of beer.
         The title of the song translated into English is: When the stars are
         shining up there. Written in waltz tempo. Hope you like it." (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Arabian_Nights.sid
COMMENT: "Demo containing this tune had a nice "gadget" enclosed. The drive led
         reacted on 1 of the tracks. (Ofcourse coded by Roland Hermans). I only
         just came up with the title of this song after Roland changed
         something in the presets (instruments) which gave it an Arabian touch.
         Ok I think. Composed on piano." (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Beast_III_Title.sid
  TITLE: Shadow of the Beast III [from the Amiga game]
 ARTIST: Tim & Lee Wright
COMMENT: "Of course I had to squeeze the Amiga 4 tracks in to c64's 3. But the
         tune uses 2 tracks for the part which isn't the lead or bass. How do
         you call that part anyway? (backing?) While going through old Amiga
         500 games with buddy Roland (we were looking through because we are
         planning a c64 demo consisting converted Amiga pics in FLI-Interlace)
         we stumbled upon this tune. I like it very much so I tried if I could
         rip it with my Datel Electronics' Amiga Action Replay MK III. I froze
         the game and typed in tracker. And golly yes! The cartridge found the
         tune and I saved it to disc and loaded it in my Protracker soundtool.
         Together with Roland I converted it. (He works much quicker than me).
         We are planning to do more conversions. After this conversion Roland
         made a program to convert from MOD to SID, right into my player as
         I said in Action Biker Remix STIL text. But now it even converts
         arpeggios! The presets are: bass from Psycho Pigs UXB. Flute resembles
         Amiga lead sample instrument but has a little waveform 41 tick at
         the beginning and is made by Roland. Other preset is from Henning
         Rokling's Henning_Rokling-02.sid which is used in demo Wild At Heart.
         We first made an arpeggio sound consisting of two different c notes
         but it didn't work out well. In beginning of the tune you can hear a
         build up of decay and sustain in this preset. To get this effect we
         had to make 4 presets just changing the decay and sustain from 2 to 8.
         The wave on effects on bass and Rokling preset make it sound ok on
         c64. Often this effect is used to substitute normal hi hat sounds.
         This ditty is one of my favourite tunes!" (JW)

         but was awarded as one of the best games in '92.
         My pally Roland Hermans (ex-Einstein/RGJ/Smidas from ATG (Actual
         Trading Generation) always helped me with the technical bits of C64
         music like players and presets etc. Some presets throughout this game
         music are from Johannes Bjerregaard's Flimbo's Quest. There's one I
         used as lead, bass and as arpeggio (chords)." (JW)

COMMENT: "This is the congratulations tune consisting a Follin like melody row
         of fast notes from a demo (forgot which one). The filter lead in the
         beginning is from Jeroen Tel's Myth tune 3. As you can hear I very
         much like to leave the bass away at the end of "saxes" to get a nice
         "echo" effect." (JW)

COMMENT: "This level tune 1, a 2-voice zax made in a simple march tempo. The

(#6)
COMMENT: "This is the high score tune. Before Forester this sound was published
         (slightly different from this one) as "Ode to Junior". Junior was a
         cat that we had at my elderly home. Was, because he's now in cat's

         arpeggio's (chord substitutes). It's still ok, I guess." (JW)
(#7)
COMMENT: "This is the bonus level tune. It's made a bit faster than the level
         tunes to get that hectic feel. Funny is the extreme fast part starting

         UXB tune 1. Lead is again of Jeroen Tel's Myth tune 3 this time

COMMENT: "Called sleeping song because Roland thought it was a song from which
         you get very sleepy. The chords are taken from the beginning of the
         music of a Dutch USA team demo called Nemesis, I made use of some
         sawtooth presets to get that Galway feel. Bassline is simply using a C
         note and the C note an octave higher. Made in Music Assembler which
         was shortened by pally Roland Hermans, so it only occupies memory from
         $1000-$12EF on the C64 which is 3 blocks (less than 1 K!). Neil
         Baldwin's Demonic-Part_1 was an example for me, using 2 tracks for
         lead when the bass is suspended. The nicest thing of the C64 sid chip
         is that you can create a warm analogue sound." (JW)

         sids are played up to 4 minutes. So I had to stop at the end of the
         4th minute. Since this msx contains a sample beat it must be played on
         an old sid, as was done on the party. You had to mention on the entry
         sheet which sid they had to use. Too bad the music was played too soft
         on the party (held during Easter). The zax might be a bit too
         long-winded. The DD III part was converted from an Amiga MOD" (JW)

COMMENT: "Look at text enclosed with Merlin's Dream. Music is the same but the
         sample beat was removed and replaced by normal C64 drums which were

         slide effect had to be inserted which wasn't in the other Parasol
         Stars tunes. This zax sounds a bit like the old Latin Lambada tune by
         Kaoma from 1987. Of course this tune was played during the game after
         the normal levels when the big boss appeared" (JW)

COMMENT: "This is a conversion of an Amiga Octamed file I found on the net. It
         was my entry for the Vision party 2001. It was the best music but
         since there were not enough entries, all entries were put into 1
         competition. It finished 4th. All presets were done by buddy Roland
         Hermans which very much sound like the Amiga ones. Great job! I always
         wanted to convert this tune and fortunately I found the Med files
         which saved me from very much work. 11 presets were used among a
         filter bass preset. I really like this tune! Anyone also wants to make
         a complete game conversion?" (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Rolfie_Title_Remix.sid
COMMENT: "This is a remix of the title theme I made for a children's cd rom I
         am making together with some pallies of mine. The cd rom is called
         "Rolfie Op Wereldreis" which is translated: "Rolfie On A World Trip"
         and is about a cat which travels around the world visiting 10
         countries from which England and America are divided into 2 pages. So
         in total there are 12 different country drawings, a title page, a
         credits page and and end page. With every page there comes an
         appropriate, spheric music plus lyrics about what can be seen in the
         drawings. All the sight seeing objects can be seen in a picture of
         each country. For instance in Egypt you can see: some pyramids, a
         sphinx, the Nile, a palm tree, some background items and Rolfie the
         cat on a camel. When you click on an object it starts to animate and a
         WAV-file begins to play making e.g. a camel sound and telling a story
         about e.g. a camel. This title tune is apart from the melody altered
         heavily to let it sound ok on the C64. This is the first tune I made
         since 1992 which was spread, so you can call it a sort of test tune.
         And this is also the first tune made for mainly Poland based group
         Axelerate which has died in the beginning of 2001. All presets are the
         same as in Linko music except before every bass sound (from 0:15),
         there is a kick drum sound added. Idea for 3 track chords in beginning
         is from Reyn Ouwehand's Deadlock (brilliant title tune). Wind sound
         was added, as always if something needs to be added, it was done by
         pally Roland 'Neo' Hermans. Hope U like it!" (JW)

         the beginning of the game. Bass and percussion were put into 1 track.
         Some wave on sounds were put on the presets of the track with the fast

         Hermans, who is a good programmer) got some tips from Charles how to
         get an oriental sound by making appropiate presets (instruments) using
         arpeggio's and flute sounds. As you can hear much transpose is used in
         all songs. This is the end of game tune." (JW)

         there will follow more. This is converted from a midi file I
         found on the net. All presets are the same but the bass
         preset is a bit softer. This preset is from Jonathan Dunn's
         Robocop. Very nice pulse thingy in it. The lead from 1:55
         is done by me. Original was played by piano as only
         instrument." (JW)

COMMENT: "Another MIDI file conversion taken from the Video Game Music Archive
         (www.vgmusic.com). It was first intended to be a high score music for
         a shoot'em up from Protovision, but they didn't want covers in their
         games. Roland and I first put the filter on the arpeggios like Robocop
         title but in most cases it is best to put it on the bass like we did
         in this tune. I think this is one of the best basslines I ever heard.
         It's pretty complex! Chris is/was probably the best German computer
         zax composer ever. I think! The arpeggios are not chords they consist
         of 2 notes. Lead is from Dunn's Robocop title, rest by Roland. Hope U
         like it!" (JW)

         use Protracker. It was meant for a C64 game Roland and I planned to
         make (Red Baron) which was never finished. The funny thing with the
         game was that you had to put the telly or monitor on its side! So you
         got an arcade feel to the game.  This tune was used in a note spread
         by JSL also from Protovision." (JW)

/Winterberg_Michael/
COMMENT: "It's a long time ago that I composed sounds for the good old C64. But
         all I remember is that it was a very great time with much fun.
         My composing started in the years 1983/84 when I programmed my own
         music-editor and the music-play-routine. I made an extra-routine for
         each sound. From music to music I changed that routine to get
         different sounds.
         I have made some musics, good and bad sounds. But I have tried to make

  TITLE: Autumn
 ARTIST: Jori Olkkonen (Yip)
COMMENT: Another version of Yip's tune from Scroll Machine, played using a
         simpler music routine, because the original music routine interfered
         with the game's code: "I had to ask Jori to make the music with
         slightly less sparse synching, but when I did that the sound quality
         dropped a bit. The result was a bearable compromise. The screen
         glitches were almost gone and the music still sounds fairly good."
         (From an interview with Pasi Hytönen, the programmer of the game, in
         MikroBITTI 4/87)
