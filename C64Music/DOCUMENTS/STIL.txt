/20CC/van_Santen_Edwin/Vlindertjes.sid
COMMENT: In a demo by Edwin van Santen, which he released about two years after
         the tune was made popular in the Papillion's crack intro, he states
         that he in fact composed the music. This demo contained a new version
         of the tune (/20CC/van_Santen_Edwin/Vlindertjes_v2.sid). He explains
         how he had made the music two years earlier on some composer like
         Soundmonitor or something similar. While at a copyparty, someone stole
         his music disk which had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the
         tune. About two months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro
         and no credit was given to van Santen.

/Audial_Arts/Peters_Patrick/Lambada.sid
  TITLE: Lambada
 ARTIST: Kaoma
COMMENT: "I can tell you that the Lambada tune, used in our demo's/openings are
         from me. At that time I hadn't any player and I didn't want to spend
         too much time in making one. I ripped the 20CC player by analyzing the
         code in assembler. Then I programmed the codeblocks myself to get the
         Lambada tune right. I laughed when 20CC found out that their player
         was used and Falco Paul or Edwin van Santen hadn't made that tune
         earlier!!! They accused me of ripping routines etc. etc. Well.. they
         were right, I never claimed that it was my player but I merged my
         Lambada tune blocks via assembler into their old music blocks (I
         overwrote it). The funniest thing was that the Lambada tune from me
         was very populair at that time. When 20CC heard it they made their own
         Lambada tune, hehehehe..." (Patrick Peters)

COMMENT: "I wrote most of Thunderforce together with my highschool friend Peter

         called Keleline. Peter was a big fan of Depeche Mode and had most of
         their records. Therefore we wanted to get some tunes from DM in the
         game. Keleline wrote to DM and first got a yes, but then the group
         decided no. At least that was the story we were told, but I think,
         that the director of the company cheated us. Somewhere out there is a
         small demo, which have the five tunes in it."

COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Brennan to be his.
         The HVSC team via their sources have checked all the original credits
         and found that most of the tunes that were supposedly done by Greg
         Holland were in fact made by Neil Brennan. For most of the games Greg
         Holland was the graphic artist rather than the composer. The HVSC Crew
         also has confirmation of this fact from a senior employee of Beam
         Software, who was on Melbourne House's main programming team at the
         time. Brennan's own comments are denoted by (NB).
         "The only musician I knew at Melbourne House pre-me (I think I started
         in 1983) was Adrian Pertout. A guy named Gavin Anderson (I think) came
         after me, but I lost contact with that company fairly quickly, so I'm

         late 70s and throughout the 80s.  It was set in the Yorkshire dales
         and featured stereotypical men wearing flat caps, hence the reason it
         is used as the music for this game!

COMMENT: All comments for this file are by Georg Feil himself and are denoted
         by (GF).
         "I wrote it around '84 or '85 as a demo for my music editor called
         'Synth'. I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just
         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on
         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.
         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with
         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I
         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like
         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.
         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.
         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of
         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that
         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had
         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,
         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed
         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little
         program with launching my musical career..." (GF)

  TITLE: Stationary Ark
 ARTIST: John Mills-Cockell <?>
COMMENT: "Theme from Stationary Ark, a nature show on PBS. [...] It appears on
         Synth Sample as interpreted by a friend of mine. I didn't know what it
         was myself until I happened to see Stationary Ark one time. This song
         does not play properly on some C-64's where the SID chip filter is
         calibrated differently." (GF)

COMMENT: "This is the music for the game which was originally titled "Perplex".
         In the beginning DRAX did the soundtrack for the game while I made
         the sfx. At some time during the production of the music, DRAX thought
         he could use some help and I agreed to do some of the music. While the
         music and sfx was done in 1990, the game was put on ice by the
         Austrian guys as they became tired of it. Some years later they
         revived the project, finished it, and sold it to a German software
         house under the new name, "Hermetic"". (JCH)

  TITLE: Rubicon, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Jeroen Tel
COMMENT: "They wanted a title-theme for Shock Magazine, and gave me the first
         issue. There was a song in there, and I had no clue what it really
         was but thought it captured the feel of the entire magazine. So I
         simply made a cover of it, Danko style. I never had any hangups about
         having to do it all, music is all about sharing and developing ideas
         together in order to reach higher grounds. The chords aren't
         identical to Jeroen's version, in fact we had a little thing over
         that at a party in Oslo back in '94 or so. We hung over a keyboard
         and I played the chords my style, and he went like 'No! It's like
         THIS!' and I said 'Well, I want it THIS way!'. *grin* One of the guys
         at the party leaned over to me and whispered that he in fact
         preferred my version of the track. *smirk* Jeroen superimposed a sus2
         chord throughout the progression until it folds back to the tonic,
         where the sus2 becomes a m7. It's a nice move, one that I personally
         use quite a lot myself. But this time around I expanded the
         progression to plain chords following the bassline.
         After I had done the tune I found out that it was from Rubicon, but
         to me it doesn't matter.
         Later on I made a remix of it, called it Schizomix, with weird
         sounds. Because Rubicon had been a double-speed song, or something
         similar, I wanted to make weird and similar sounds but in a single-
         speed player. And that's all it was, a messed up version of my first
         cover so to speak." (TD)

         While the the Amiga versions of Demonware's games The Power and Ooops
         Up had digitracks of the Snap songs, Detert was instructed NOT to do a
         cover of The Power by Snap for this soundtrack, obviously the guys at
         Snap meanwhile changed their minds about their agreement with
         Demonware.
         The C64 version of Ooops Up was never finished, early soundtrack
         versions done by Rodney Balai did feature a cover of the Snap song
         though. (see /Audial_Arts/Balai_Rodney/Ooops_Up.sid)

         'updating' them to put them onto a different instrument. If you ever

         thinking Ocean would publish a "Neverending Story" game, it was very
         much just a cool tune to do. (It was a Georgio Moroder filler tune,
         whose style I had a lot of respect for as a producer). It was the
         first tune I did pulse-width sweeps on, but didn't get released 'til

         "Well by the time I got to that game (1988) I was a bit hard up for
         ideas. I didn't know what to do with so few notes available! I wanted
         my tunes to build up into much larger entities but I always hit this
         limit. Plus the time at which that game was developed was a pretty
         rough time for Sensi, none of us were too happy at the time. Insects
         In Space was a victim of this. True though, it certainly has

/Galway_Martin/Miami_Vice.sid
COMMENT: "The Miami Vice game was a very quick job. I had been handed 'Miami
         Vice' and 'Highlander' because the outside development team working on
         it hadn't worked out who was going to do the sound (notice those games
         have little or no sound-effects), so I did my best in a very short
         time. I [...] picked 'The Chase' and the 'Main Theme' as the two tunes
         I would do. We had settled on two modes for the game - in your car and
         out of it I think. (Or maybe it was in the game and out of it, I can't
         remember.) I started on 'The Chase' and if you listen to the first few
         seconds of that you can hear the basis of that super-filter-echo tune
         that is so cool. I recall David Collier was sitting in the office with
         me while I was working on it. But while messing with it while everyone
         else was at lunch, I came across this cool sound. I added to it and
         added to it, and when we applied the non-sync'd filter sweep we both
         flipped out! I decided to abandon the conversion of that tune and
         simply go with the cool sounds I had stumbled upon. When the guys came
         back from lunch and listened to it they swore that there was a
         cassette deck connected somewhere and it wasn't the C64 playing it!
         Such a sound had not been heard before by any of us out of the C64. So
         I extended it and turned it into this tripping-out 11-minute piece.
         The main theme itself... I simply did my best with no drums (Rob
         Hubbard's strength). I think my strength with guitar solos helped pull
         it off. Both of those problematic games benefited from my music,
         actually, and the Ocean management were very relieved
         (understatement)." (MG)

COMMENT: "The 'version 1' is a real tune, it was really like that on
         Hypersports and maybe one or two other games before Comic Bakery
         (Cyclone would have used it, for example, but it was never released by
         Ocean). The delay at 02:03.00 really is supposed to be a delay of 4
         beats." (MG)
         Because of the delay Martin mentioned at 2:03, it led a lot of people
         to believe later parts of the tune went out of synch and it was
         bugged. However, this has been confirmed as intentional. This version
         was known to have been used in Hyper Sports and Transformers.

/Galway_Martin/Ocean_Loader_2.sid
COMMENT: "'version 2' was a reworking of that tune that I did in late 1985 for
         Comic Bakery. There was actually supposed to be separate loading music
         for every game - that was my plan.  However, I was running out of time
         on projects and in the case of C.B. I simply reworked an older piece.
         After that I _really_ didn't have time to mess with it, and it stuck
         in universal use. Rambo was the only one that got its own loading
         music as part of this plan." (MG)

         Parallax, without realizing that Rendez-vous was unconsciously
         creeping into the music. He realized it only after he played the album
         again after the game was already shipped.
         "[Parallax] was 11 minutes long, certainly my longest at the time. I
         took my development gear home to work on it for a week or two. I just
         said to myself 'OK, it's going to be this mega-tune, so the intro has
         to be mega'. The intro took up two-thirds of the tune! I actually got
         bored with it, and stuck that silly melody on the end which doesn't
         really match. Going back I would have made it less melodic. I wanted
         to reflect the gigantic visual proportions represented by the parallax
         effect in the game so that's why it has an 'epic' feel."(MG)

COMMENT: "Can't quite remember what happened with 'Ping Pong'. I seem to
         remember not having very much time to work on it. I do recall working
         late on it after everyone else had left, because perhaps I was going
         on holiday the next day or something. (Was it around September-1987?)
         The arcade game didn't have any music on the 'press start' screen, so
         it would have been a natural for an original tune. Maybe everyone
         regarded it as a 'baby game' which didn't merit much attention. CAN'T
         QUITE REMEMBER, sorry!" (MG)

         imagine my disappointment. One of the other tunes was easy, that's the
         simple ballad melody 'come and follow me', which I was able to arrange
         quite successfully. The other one was a nightmare since it's the tune
         right from the beginning of the movie with all the robotic short notes
         & arpeggios. The tune just built up so massive that the poor C64 was
         short of notes by about 30 seconds into it, so I had to fudge the end

COMMENT: "The game was re-assigned in early 1986 to Comic Bakery's programmer
         Colin Gresty and artist Steve Wahid, and they enthusiastically got
         to work on it, coming up with an all-new approach with nicer
         graphics - more like the early Grand Theft Auto games (top-down viewed
         from a chase camera).  However it was very slow going for those guys
         and while the art/design was done by mid-1987, Colin was still
         finishing the programming towards the end of that year, say, about
         September.  Ocean, who'd been advertising the game in magazines for
         months, were very annoyed by this delay and were not going to make
         their intended profit. (Perhaps their option window to publish the
         game was expiring too, who knows?) So they cancelled the project when
         it was at the 99%-complete stage and fired Colin." (MG)

         incorporated that weird sound from the Parallax walking around

COMMENT: "Of course I have recollections... where do I begin... are you
         sitting comfortably?  The fact that there are two versions of
         Streethawk music is part of the whole mystery of Streethawk, really.
         It started in 1985 and was programmed by Mike Webb, who'd just come
         off Amstrad Kong Strikes Back. Lateral thinker that he is, he had a
         rather unique design going (a sideways scrolling platform-jumping
         design which is probably now lost forever), and I think he went on
         holiday for a week or two, and when he came back they decided to have
         him do another project - or, he left to join forces with Richard Kay
         at Software Creations.  (He definitely did the latter, but I can't

         stab at the title screen music without doing anything else.  I did it
         some time in the summer of 1985, so it sonically resembles
         Cyclone/Helicopter Jagd and Neverending Story.  There was no filter
         technology in my driver. All that Ocean had as reference for the show
         was an NTSC tape of the pilot episode of the series, which we were
         able to play on our futuristic, highly-technical NTSC-playback VCR/TV.

COMMENT: "I tried to create this feeling of a massive behemoth robot monster on
         its way to destroy you. Thus the marching beat and the minor chords
         and stark tones. I had to stick in the inevitable jamming solo towards
         the end of course. I was starting to face the glass ceiling imposed by
         the filter on the C64. While my particular SID sounded great, others
         were not like it at all and the solos were almost inaudible! At the
         other extreme the new C64C's were coming out and this filter
         unreliability had been fixed as part of a silicon revision. BUT the
         filters were way too open all the time and you could hardly hear any
         filtering! This caused the filtered note to come out a lot louder than
         it should have and 'stick out' rather unattractively. So I developed a
         'filter adjustment' parameter for my music program which would allow
         the customer to control this filter unreliability and get their
         particular machine to sound cool. But David Collier never put it in
         the options screen. (DOH!) There's always something wrong, eh?" (MG)

COMMENT: "The most complex original tune I did was the 'Times Of Lore' title
         tune, it took 20 days just to do the guitar solos! It has a random
         number generator which selects different guitar solos, but I didn't

COMMENT: "I was working at the Sensible Software office at the time of the
         major music creation, but the title screen music never got finished.
         When I returned to Ocean I got on with some other things, all the time
         worrying about this unfinished tune. Finally I slapped something on
         the end of it. I knew I could never top the first part, that's what
         the problem was. In my mind the second part of the tune is pretty lame
         compared with the first part. But for some people it represents the
         mysterious, magical, unconventional aspect of 'Wizball' so it fits in
         some ways. But you can tell it's not really like the other music in
         the game, which was primarily developed when I was with the Sensi
         boys, basking in that Sensi VIBE." (MG)

         at full volume on his band's P.A. in their rented terraced house in
         Southend (not caring about what the neighbours thought!!!) - and while

         note (my favourite beginning note of course, G - almost everything I
         do is in G). So I plugged in this echoing waveform thing and let it
         rip. The tune isn't particularly Chinese sounding, but I was working
         on producing that 'perfect melody', the one you'd be humming all day,
         you know. That was a phase I went through. [...] The sound I was
         converting from was itself a conversion of the arcade cabinet, which I
         have NEVER SEEN. It sounded like it was a lame conversion too, so I
         easily did a better sounding version. (The MSX's music only used two

COMMENT: "[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music was Gary Liddon's idea.
         [...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told Rob Hubbard
         to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side of the Moon
         by Pink Floyd." (Info from Matt Furniss.)
         "The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and Romeo/Juliet
         music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such as end of
         level, extra life etc..."
         "Delta was based on this minimalist composition technique inspired by
         Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard to do and required
         some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was tedious to
         debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite liked the
         other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week period....." (RH)
         According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
         to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
         insane.

         voices for all these tunes because I used the other for SFX...... Most
         of the tunes were sketched out on a small keyboard and manuscript
         paper. I used paper to keep track of the basic ideas and arrangement,
         and I still have all the original manuscripts. A lot of the
         manuscripts are not readable because I used to work very fast and
         never updated many of the changes I made. I used to use a machine code
         monitor to edit music data and sound patch data on the file while the

         The Last V8 was the first game released by Mastertronic's new label

         main theme music (subtune #1) falls out of synch at around the one

         the synth solo in Sanxion is actually pretty melodic, even after all
         these years! I did do a much slower version on the Amiga once, but
         have no idea what ever happened to it."

/Hubbard_Rob/Thrust.sid
COMMENT: Review copies of this game had a bugged loader which mucked up the

         Julian Rignall (ex-editor of Zzap! 64) takes up the story:
         "I remember the God awful cacophony that was our review copy of
         Thrust's music as though it were still playing. This was the problem:
         the drum sounds worked, but all the other instrument sounds were
         screwed - basically it resulted in this horrible screeching noise
         playing to drums, rather than the cool heavyish sound that was heard
         in the final version of the game. It sounded really harsh and so it
         was duly shot down by us in the review. I remember hearing the
         'proper' version of the game at a later dater and thinking 'ooooops!'.
         After all it was a classic tune (it became one of my faves, indeed)
         and we'd mercilessly beaten it down in the review, which was totally
         unfair. Still, it was good to be able to do a ZZAPback on it and
         remedy the error."

  TITLE: Delta Force Title Theme [from the movie]

/Huelsbeck_Chris/R-type.sid
COMMENT: Very interesting story here. Katakis was released in September 1988 by
         Rainbow Arts, however it never got a release in the UK as Activision
         had it cancelled because of similarities to R-type, to which
         Activision had bought the conversion rights. Activision were getting
         nowhere with their conversion of R-Type and they liked what they saw
         of Katakis, so they hired the same programming team (Manfred Trenz and
         others) to do the C64 conversion. They only got 6 weeks to write the
         conversion, and sadly, it shows. Katakis was eventually altered and
         released as Denaris in 1989. Tunes #2 to #14 all cover of the arcade
         game.

         modulation effects and was used in a "Pretzel Logic" demo.

/JCH/Hawaii.sid
COMMENT: A very long tune containing one of the longest solo parts I have ever
         done in a C64 tune. The bassline and drums were originally made by
         Morten Sigaard Kristensen, but in the end I "raped" it so much that it
         virtually became my own work. The solo part starts at 01:39. Notice
         how the tune decays in the end - this was very unusual on the C64.

/JCH/Hexagon_Party.sid
COMMENT: Made FOR that party, not AT it. The tune contains quite a lot of

         instead of creating a new one.

         "DRAX" was asked to convert the tune for a certain sum of money but,
         as he said himself, he wasn't sure he could convert it so he asked me
         for help. I completed the conversion for the ridiculous sum of money.
         Later, "DRAX" admitted that he didn't complete the conversion because
         he thought the original Amiga music was boring. I must confess that he
         has a point there.

/JCH/Shift.sid
COMMENT: A worktune that wasn't finished. Due to the fact that we have reached

         the editor alone. The digi voice doesn't appear until 01:16 - it was
         supposed to be a "surprise" tune. This was also the last digital tune
         I did - and as far as I can remember, the very last C64 tune as well.

  TITLE: Hugo Rap Theme
 ARTIST: <?>
COMMENT: A professional software house in Denmark called "SilverRock" gained a
         lot of success with "Hugo" in danish television. This troll could be
         controlled in a game using telephone buttons. A very new concept which
         soon became enormously popular. During the success of the troll, a
         real musician produced a CD containing a rap hit where Hugo was
         singing using the typical voice which was also used in the game. As
         the game was converted for sales versions from the Amiga to PC and
         C64, I did the C64 song converted from the Danish rap hit.

COMMENT: I always get mixed feelings when I play this music. The title- tune is
         long and I put a lot of work into it in april 1989, but today I can
         hear loads of harmonic errors here and there. The game was done for a
         sideways shoot'em up which a couple of totally unknown danish guys was
         making. They soon lost all interest in their game, however. The
         hiscore theme was a conversion of the old Cliff Richard hit
         "Congratulations" done right out my head. I always wanted to make such
         a hiscore tune, because I always thought Rob Hubbard did it all wrong
         when he made "sad" hiscore tunes. It is a sad thing when the game
         ends, but getting a high score is supposed to be a GOOD thing! :)

/JCH/Non_JCH_Newplayer/Typhus_1.sid
COMMENT: This is the only tune I did in Future Composer, made at the Dexion
         copy-party in 1988, the same party where I was told by Laxity to keep
         my hands off his player. The Future Composer was a hack editor on
         Charles Deenen's player and it arrived at this party for the first
         time. I tried it out once - and never touched it again. "Typhus" was
         the name of the german guy who also ordered the "Sharks" music in the
         old player.
         Composed in Future Composer, tune length is 0:46.

  TITLE: Hoodoo Voodoo
 ARTIST: Graham Marsh (BOGG)
COMMENT: "Icups - my first published work... I had written the tune as a demo,
         and I had been trading with Bogg for a few years, and I had re-written
         his tune just to see how I would have taken his initial idea and run
         with it myself. Anyways, I had sent disks with a load of tunes on to
         all the major software companies at the time. Firebird contacted me,
         they wanted to use Icups. I told them at the time that it was kind of
         a rip off of Bogg's Detergent, but they were quite happy to offer to
         buy it. They offered me 150 pounds, and then when someone pointed out
         again to them that it was based on Bogg's tune, they gave him half the
         money too which I was quite happy with." (BL)

  TITLE: Monty on the Run, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Rob Hubbard
COMMENT: Due to a bug in the game code, when the game switched from the title
         screen to the high score table, it placed forty or so incorrect bytes
         into the music routine, making the theme tune bug and play one of the
         voices at the wrong pitch. Leitch has confirmed that this rip is
         bug-free.
         "OK, so they asked me to do a dancey remix of Rob Hubbards classic C64
         theme and they wanted scratch sounds in it. I went over the top. I'm
         sorry Rob." (BL)

         the decision as to who won.. The reason the other guy won was because
         he'd written like 20 tunes and sent them all in so they let him win
         for doing so much work, but they all agreed mine was better ! :)

         was also a member of at the time). According to Mark Kelly, the game
         was to be published by Hewson but due to licencing disagreements with
         Firebird (Sophistry being similar to Firebird's Zolyx) the game was
         cancelled.

         This is probably one of my most used tunes. Back in 1990, when it was

         immediately after listening to a Charles Deenen tune for some

         It has a catchy theme though I think. Lion/Chromance used this for the
         intro for Domination #8. The tune was supposed to be exclusive, but
         then suddenly out of the blue an old AVT-project called 'Icarus'
         surfaced, and as my tune was first intended for that production I was

         I made this tune in December 1991 especially for the upcoming Lethal

         just started his software label called Imagination Developments. So,
         at The Party 1 in 1991 he got the finished tune and plugged it into
         the demo, which was then released... Syndrom liked this tune so much
         that he did a 90% copy of it. He explained to me later on, that he did
         it to gain experience, which is OK my me, but unfortunately it got

         This tune was made after fiddling around on my synth. I came up with

         This tune - as you may be able to hear - has a few sequences similar

         Note-it 1 - adding some other chord-theme and yet another note-tune
         was done... I should probably never have released these 2 tunes as I

/Ouwehand_Reyn/Last_Ninja_3.sid
(#3)
COMMENT: The tune falls out of synch at around 4:50, which is when the tune
         should loop. However, this is due to the music data in the game
         behaving exactly the same way. You would never get to hear this part
         of the tune in the game, as the intro would finish and load the first
         level before the music got to that point.
         "I guess I had some time pressure... I knew it would fade away
         anyhow... never thought about that fact that people in 2000 would
         listen to it with SIDPlay.... :)" (RO)
         The data has been restored in this SID, to make it loop properly,
         and is confirmed by Reyn to be correct.

         just seeing what you could do with a few basic sequences by mixing and
         transposing them. At the time I didn't really like 'acid' music, I was
         more likely to listen to John Cage or Pierre Henry, so I wasn't really
         sure how to write it. SoedeSoft editor again. Horrible drums again,

/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Feedback_Experiment.sid
COMMENT: "This tune does exactly what it says on the box, basically trying to
         get a ring-mod effect that sounded like an electric guitar being left
         leaning on a Marshall amplifier turned up to 11. I was fairly pleased
         with the result, it sounds quite uncomfortable on headphones. The tune
         was written on a SoedeSoft editor, which explains the rather fuzzy
         triggering and messy drum sounds, but gliding and filter control was
         much more versatile than anything else around at the time, I felt, and
         you could sustain notes for about 5 hours. The tune was not written
         especially for the "Acid At The PC Show" demo, having being composed
         around 8 weeks earlier, but Shane (coder) wanted to use them." (BH)

         SoedeSoft (I think) at 5am on the Sunday morning of the 1989 PC Show
         in London (hence the demo title). Has a long ending after a drum solo
         that John Bonham would probably laugh at. I also did a version of this
         tune in Ubiks Music in 1988, which was even worse. I hope that's never

         and this is one of my very favourite C64 tunes ever. It was never
         meant to be released but we ended up sticking in on an SG demo disk
         anyway. Note that one of the arpeggios is a bit wonky, and I couldn't
         be bothered to do the start of the piece, but I felt that it was a
         pretty good sound-a-like." (BH)

/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Greed_Monster.sid
COMMENT: "Another day, another pointless budget game. Yogi Bear deserved
         better! I can't remember if I composed the tune or if it was a
         conversion of some Atari ST music, written by some bloke who's name I
         can't remember. We used to do a few conversions back then. These were
         great fun to do. The software company would sent Gerard Gourley a copy
         of the original music, usually recorded on a cassette recorder sitting
         by the TV. He'd then play the tune down the telephone to me, and I'd
         record it on another cassette from the telephone's earpiece. The
         resulting hi-fidelity master recording would then be my basis. I
         usually had to guess at the basslines, as they'd become totally
         inaudible on the tape. Then I'd U-U the result back to Gerard within 2
         hours, and if I was lucky I'd get £100 about 6 months later after the
         'middle man' had taken his bit. Or half that if the tune was for
         Ocean." (BH)

/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Prison_Riot.sid
COMMENT: "Composed for another dodgy budget game, in the old SG editor I think,
         which was written by Andy Lumley. I probably had about 12 hours notice
         to write this... Zzap reviewed it and called it siren 'music', so they
         can't have listened to more than about 10 seconds of it. I quite liked
         it at the time, but more for the effects than the rather scrappy lead
         lines. Tune 4 was totally different in style, for the hiscore table.
         The main tune seems to be bugged near the end - this must have
         happened when the file was inserted into the game, it was OK when it
         left me. To be honest, music for this sort of game was an afterthought
         - and for the money I was getting, I wasn't about to try and write an
         epic!" (BH)

         yes with a capital Y.
         Charles Deenen said it was the "best music I made on c64" when I
         finished it. (I do NOT agree ofcourse, although I must say it's the
         best "filmscore" soundtrack I've done for a game on the c64. I
         actually got some kind of filmscript for it, that's why I could be

COMMENT: This tune was the original prototype for the title theme from Savage.

         His most notorious use of this was a Dutch TV programme called 'Pisa'
         (filmed from the leaning tower) with Harry saying his 'Koud He?'
         catchphrase to everyone that went by. Probe Software then heard the
         tune and asked Jeroen if he'd change the samples, and lo and behold it
         became the Savage theme.
         "Some background info. The 'KOUD HE' sample is from a Dutch comedian
         called 'Harry Vermeegen'. It was like a hype saying. I found it a nice

          is my version of the battle theme from Chrono Trigger.
          Unfortunately, I had to cut out the drum track from part of
          the song to make room for the marimba part. (It wouldn't have
          worked to mix them, the drum track is too intense.) Oh well,

         is "It," the ending theme. This is because the timing was so totally
         screwed up that I couldn't make head or tail of it. Oh well. BTW, the
         song names here are the filenames minus the .ddt extension. P.S. If
         anyone wants to attempt a C=64 port of Jill (not outside the realm of
         possibility, in my opinion,) feel free to use this. The sample channel

          version was BAD, and the only other SID author who took a stab at
          it was Jesper Olsen. (Some guy did the Atari version, but that
          sucked compared to the arcade/64 version.) So I made my own remix.
          I added some other parts to it, basically with a nicer drum track
          and another voice added onto the bassline. Actually, this started
          out as a Protracker MOD, but I just HAD to do a SID version of

COMMENT: "[A cover of] Mystified by Jogeir Lijehdal.  [However], when I showed
         Geir Tjelta this tune, I had another name for it..  And then he came
         with this story about Bug or Bogg having done the original tune and
         that he had committed suicide.. So I changed the name of the tune to
         'Ode to Bugg' .." (GRG).
         Stein Erik Giske (Bug of Subway, Razor 1911) was killed in 1992 as a
         result of a car accident, and not suicide (Info from Jan Harries)

         which stands back with their dead son or daughter is so unhappy and
         sad that they don't know anything anymore. They're feeling a huge
         emptyness inside, they only wish their child back again, staying
         alive. But that will never happen... The last few minutes when the
         child was alive, it dreamed about a sky of marvelous and wonderful
         things flying all around. The longer it lasted the longer away this
         person was to all real things we know here on earth. This child, so
         young, has left the world. Not alive anymore. Doesn't exist, only the
         body left for the family to bury and their memories to keep. Why do
         some want to legalize it?" (KN)

         and tracked within  hours on january, 23rd. This is a kind of jazz
         tune, it's not my style ya know, but I felt like doing a tune like
         this because lots a people like it. Therefore I added sum of my music
         style to the tune, that's why it sounds a bit techno like.. Try to
         enjoy this tune with a stereo, you'll like it I guess.. By the way
         remember that all C128 computers have a different filter set on their
         sid chips,so the music sounds a bit different than on normal c64
         computers, you'll hear the difference on the bass, the filters doesn't
         open theirselves so much on C128! But who the fuck cares, this music
         runs on all computers, that's what counts! [...]"

         strange break in the middle thats quite fun. The name of the tune is

         from Megastyle that they wanted me as a member making tons of
         intro/demo-tunes. I got their editor but they never used ANY of my
         music. Their player was based on JB/MON's Stormlord tunes. I decided
         to join my local friends in the Norway/Finland/Germany-based group
         Antimon instead. Most of my music had been used by them anyway. This
         is like most of my tunes in in C-minor and rather sad sounding. I put
         a lot of work into this one (and not quitting early like usually do).
         I used this tune in a demopart with an atom-plotter (Antimon is an
         atom ya know). Editor=Megastyle-editor" (ELA)

COMMENT: "I had just got hold of Rockmonitor2 in 1987 and slowly tried out what
         it had. This tune still contains lots of music from the default-tune
         and probably all the default sounds as it took months before I learned
         how to make my own sounds. It has no drumsamples here either because
         that took a while to learn too. I converted it to Soundmonitor to save
         space (it didnt need the sample data anyway)" (ELA)

COMMENT: All comments by Antti Hannula (AH)
         "I practiced a lot making sids in the late 1980s but released my
         first tunes in 1990.  After Antti Kangas (Scorpion) finished
         his first music routine for Artline Designs (ALD) we started to
         release "quality-sounds".  Before ALD I was the founder member of
         Contex.  All tunes were composed with an assembler.  Reach me via
         <anttihan (sid) hotmail.com>" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/ATA.sid
COMMENT: "Released in 1992, made with ALD-player v3.0 which was developed late
         1990. The routine turned out to be the one I used most, though v3.7
         was even ready at the time.
         The tune itself was the first one I was asked to do for a game. ATA
         was a Tetris-clone done by German Lower Level and I don't recall if I
         got paid for the track, but anyway it was liked by the authors and
         apparently many others.
         This must have been the best track I've done if I don't take count on
         my new tunes. I wasn't anymore much into composing that time, I just
         composed as a time-killer. Also a high score track was included." (AH)

  TITLE: The Twilight Zone [from the TV series]
 ARTIST: Lalo Schifrin
COMMENT: "My first 'good' song with ALD-player v2.1 and one of the few covers I
         ever did. V2.1 didn't have any pulse data for $41 sounds so therefore
         I just used $11 or $21 to have acceptable melody-sounds.
         I was just playing around with the routine and somehow the Zone-theme
         appeared into my mind, but it's only influenced by the theme and the
         rest of the tune was just an effort of imagination.
         Done in January/February 1990." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/B-Ball.sid
COMMENT: "The B-Ball sounds were ordered in the Autumn 92 just after I had
         released my second music-collection which apparently didn't get spread
         much as I sent it to my old pals, which I even didn't know if they
         were in the scene anymore or not. The B-Ball track however, never got
         released as the game wasn't sold (I guess). I liked this track a lot
         myself and in fact it was the first time I had to do jingles. The
         player I used was v3.6. B-Ball was the last (finished) track I did
         until now in 1999." (AH)

COMMENT: "Done in April 1999, yes! The first C64 tune after 1992. This tune
         participated in Proxy 99 party in Finland, even though I wasn't
         present it won the C64 music competition. Some people were really
         amazed to see a track from me for a long long time. I made the basis
         for it with Fasttracker and this is the way I compose the tunes these
         days. It's not a hard job to 'convert' the into assembler if you just
         make the tunes in a 64-style." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Compact.sid
COMMENT: "Yet another one done in April 1999. I fixed this one just after
         Beyond Grave, but this one I did with the old style - just playing
         around with the routine. Later on I discovered that the arpeggios
         turned out to be much like in Hawkeye by Jeroen Tel. I intended to do
         a slow tune and this is what came out of my head." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Conflex.sid
COMMENT: "Done in 1990 with v3.0 and was released in my Music Pack #1.
         Nothing special there though I remember I liked it very much back in
         1990. Somehow the "wind-effect" turned out to be in many of my tunes,
         including this one as well. The name comes from Con(tex) and Flex."

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Discoland.sid
COMMENT: "I composed this one with Fasttracker II and of course with c64
         sounds. This time transforming the .xm into our c64 music-routine
         turned out to be quite tricky (maybe I just wasn`t in the mood)...
         Anyway, I like the melody and I say that`s the most important element
         in a sid tune." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Drivers_Dog.sid
COMMENT: "The name comes from Shell`s hot dog which I often eat when coming
         home from my DJ gigs. Quite funky tune and I`m quite pleased with the
         "2nd part" of the song. Uses player v3.7 which was the last ALD-player
         and is the only one which offers you the chance to put bassdrum into
         bass-sound." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/FanFarewell.sid
COMMENT: "V2.8 production which was a huge step in sounds compared to v2.1 or
         v2.4. I made several tunes with this player back in 1990. The tune
         itself is just a fanfare as you can hear, you could say that this was
         my first high-score track!" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Feelin_Blue.sid
COMMENT: "Was actually my first released tune and used in the last Contex demo
         called "Handjob Lotion" released May 1990. Used player v2.1 and you
         can hear it from the $21 melody sound. I remember Zardax/Origo played
         this melody in the air pretending there was a keyboard under his
         fingers and asked me what is the song he's playing.. of course I knew
         it!" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Frazze.sid
COMMENT: "Also in "Handjob Lotion" and done with v2.1 as well. This time I used
         $11 melody-sound. Afterwards I've been told this one was at least used
         in a Talent-intro and in Royal Writer. Someone's been liking it." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Frequency_69.sid
COMMENT: "Done somewhere around late 1991 and released 1992. This was my effort
         to do a techno-track. Uses $15 or $17 ring modulation, $11 bass-drum
         and $11 bass which is played low. I just loved using low frequency
         bass (LFO/LFO) and the tune was inspired by a band called Rhythmatic.
         Scrap/Genesis Project (ex-Contex) reviewed this tune and commented 'Is
         my compu broken?'" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Ghettoblaster.sid
COMMENT: "Player v2.8. This tune appeared to sound like a general Finnish
         melancholic tune. Nothing special in it." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Jammin.sid
COMMENT: "This one was meant to be a jamming intro-tune, nothing else. I
         created a "going" bassline and simple chorus into it and later on I
         added a short melody. I like it!" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Mello-D_Pop.sid
COMMENT: "I can recall quite clearly that I designed the arpeggios with my
         synthesizer and that was all I needed. I also used to create the
         melodies by playing the bass and chorus from C64 and the melody from
         the synth, it was quite easy. However, I should have done longer
         melodies, too often the melody lasted for 16 beats and then I just
         repeated it." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Mindblowing.sid
COMMENT: "The intro music for "The Return of A" - my music collection #2.
         The first time I used $11 in arpeggios. I think this tune got its
         right atmosphere right from the beginning. The pulse bassdrum was
         meant to be as a heartbeat, oooh I loved the bass-sound. So simple so
         cool!" (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/My_First_Introtune.sid
COMMENT: "OK, who could have avoided Future Composer? I practiced a lot with it
         and this one was actually made back in 1988, but I never got the
         courage to release it.. I wonder why, after eleven years it actually
         sounds quite nice (done by me when I was 14)." (AH)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Hannula_Antti/Needle.sid

COMMENT: "Well, this is the one that actually swings! Done in April 1992 and
         released separately at the same time as music collection #2. This one
         is an exception to my usual formula which was "there must be a

          we forgot to test the tune on a real machine - and it was crucial,
          because strange filter settings make this one sound COMPLETELY
          BROKEN on C64. The title appears to fit perfectly in this case, I
          think. No wonder it was voted that low: 17th out of 19 at North
          Party 8 in 2003. So, use SIDPlay2/w." (comment by Smalltown Boy)

         incredibly dark, having spent the last week in bed ill, I really
         wanted to go home, or failing that, I wanted someone to take a few
         minutes out of their day to see if I was still alive (okay, so I was
         feeling kind of melodramatic, lol),  This girl promised to hang out
         with me, and then cancelled or forgot every time for weeks straight,
         and I was stupid (read: thinking with my heart instead of my head)
         and didn't want to acknowlage that she was ignoring me...  I was
         losing my mind, and this music represents that.
         The full verse is "Blood, Starlight, Rain like tears, Drink from
         this, and let go the years".  I don't know who penned those words, but
         I dropped the latter half from the title because I promised said girl
         that I would.
         This music was made on an emulator (vice 1.8, and of course I had
         resid turned on :-p).  It was also one of my bigger expermients with
         filters synced from different channels to the one they're targetting.

         (see TFX == future composer), and the other guys were going to do
         modern music blah blah watever, i forget the details.  Anyhow, around
         2 minutes after I sat down at the editor, it instead became something
         else (I hate it when that happens :-p), which basically amounts to an
         attempt to place what was goes through my mind at the time into sid
         form... the evolution of my soul.  I achieved that, I think, which is
         probably why almost no-one else understands it.  I personally like

COMMENT: "This is the second attempt I made to do this song on the c64, and was
         in fact the song that TFX table variables were created for.  I
         originally tried to do this in sid duzz it in early 1999, but the
         number of arpeggio commands required for the places where there is
         two leads in one channel, and the blips in the drum/bass channel,
         overwelmed that editor.  So I tried in JCH v20g4, where I had managed
         to succed with Sunset Spirals, due to the ability it has to change the
         wavetable from within a song, but this too was not to be, due to the
         limitations of the editor.  So, I started writing a new editor, which
         was specifically designed to handle this situation, by splitting each
         channel into six virtual channels, and using special rules to modulate
         them together.  But this took up a lot of ram and raster time, indeed
         it too so much ram in the editor that I could only store five patterns
         at a time, so this was not to be either.  So Ray introduced me to TFX,
         and I asked him about changing the wave table from within the song,
         but he wouldn't have this, because it would confuse people, but he
         suggested a viable alternative, which is to support variables in the
         wave table, and promised to add this feature asap.  That was January
         2001, but he was too busy to implement them for the next two and a
         half years.  So I started bugging him to just give me the source and
         the bits to build it, and in November 2003,  he did.  So, I put my
         money where my mouth was, and added that feature (and a bunch of
         others which I had been wanting for a long time), and I was _finally_
         able to do a version of this that I happy with.  To anyone else but
         me, this is just another mediocre game tune, but for me it was an
         achievement." (JJ)

COMMENT: "Anyone who played the arcade game much knows that Ben's cover of it
         was a bit crap (I'd blame a lack of channels on the c64 for harmonies,
         but his amiga version is just as crap), and everyone else's C64 covers
         seem to cover his crap version, not the arcade version.  So, my
         version is crap too, but I think it has the nice harmonies in the
         second half, at least, and I think is a little less crap than his :)."

COMMENT: "After Sunset Sprirals, I was once again fed up with JCH's editor, and
         wanted something better.  Ray had suggested to me using TFX several
         times before, and I finally got some documentation for it, and so now
         was the time to use it.  I had the S3M of this kicking around, and so
         I covered it to learn the editor.  The instruments suck... I never was
         good at making percussion, and unfortunantly there isn't any good ones
         around made in TFX to rip.  I also had basically zero understanding of
         how the wave tables worked when I did this, and as a result there are
         some very stupid things in there which sound terrible ;).  This
         probably should never have been released, but people liked it for
         reasons that I don't understand.
         As it turned out, the instruments sounded so crap partially because
         Ray's player was horrifically bugged, at the time.  I recompiled it
         against a later player, and it sounds a LOT better." (JJ)

COMMENT: "So, TFX 2.9 still wasn't here, but I wanted to cover this 4 channel
         music from the atari, so what I did, is set the player to 1 frame per
         row, and then enter all of the arpeggios by hand.  I'm surprised it
         didn't make the file much larger than it is.  It was a pain in the

COMMENT: "This song is made up entirely of patterns from Fishmagic, but played

         intended to be used in a demo with fishmagic, so I was going for that
         similar but different effect, and I think it worked very well.  But,
         ironically, I was never happy enough with the original fishmagic, or
         how the demo was turning out, so I gave this to Jazzcat for an issue
         of Vandalism News, for which it was much more suitable anyhow. I love
         this sort of song, why don't people do more of them?" (JJ)

/VARIOUS/G-L/Julian_Jaymz/Sonic_Dreams.sid
COMMENT: "This was my entry for the 2004 SidWine competition, and it did
         fantasitcally badly, despite being what I consider to be probably the
         best demoscene style song that I've done on the c64.  I actually spent
         a lot of time on this song, and I was quite proud of how it turned out
         when it was finished.  It makes extensive use of the TFX wave table
         variables to try and squeeze two melody lines into a single channel,
         and the NoPulse command to control pulse width modulation reset more
         finely.
         The song is dedicated to a group I used to be a part of, Sonic Dreams,
         which is another story." (JJ)

COMMENT: "This is, musically, probably the best thing that I have ever done on
         the c64.  Ironically, all of my c64 friends complained that it was off
         key, etc, and all of my PC friends love this version.  Yet I had
         exactly the opposite reaction to the original version (c64 guys tended
         to like it, pc guys tended to complain that it was off key.).  For the
         record, except for one or two notes, because I ran out of arpeggios (I
         do that a lot... there are two or three other musics which got
         scrapped half way through because I ran out of arpeggios.  Thankfully,
         we've come up with a solution to this in the new version of TFX :)),
         the notes are NOT off key, and I don't care what you all think :-p.
         Said PC guys decided to take ownership of this song, and wanted me to
         create more like it, but I havn't had the motivation to actully
         finish any of them. (There are many, many, many stories that I could
         tell about the digiradi guys, but that's for another day, but the
         credit of the music to "Coder" is a part of that insanity.  They were

         he shows off 80's home keyboards, and other chip instruments,
         including a commodore 64 with a guitar strap attached.  Loscha and I
         were at one of his gigs, and he was tanking really badly (indeed, we
         could remember more of the words to his songs than he could!).  This
         was mostly because, we think, he was completly off the planet.  So, we
         came back to my place, after the gig, and I was showing off the new
         version of TFX, and we wrote the bass/chord/drum line (which is all
         one channel) to demonstrate some of the new features.  The file needed
         a name, and so we just typed in "Tim got high", and the name stuck.
         This song also has a lot of ring modulation (Joxstrap/WOW said too

         wanted to make a c64 version of this for a long time, but it took me
         until now to really work out how to do it to my liking.
         Throwing that piece of junk away to concentrate on c64 music was the

COMMENT: "This is the only released music made in the modified version of JCH's
         player that I was hacking up during 1999 (I had all of my stuff
         stolen, including the only copy of the player sources etc).  I
         originally wanted to create Galway style tune, but changed my mind
         half way and thought I'd make a Drax style music instead, and then put
         a JCH style lead on it.  Read the title backwards, and it will all
         make sense. This was also the first music of mine that I know of to be
         used in someone else's production (of course *I* use my own music, but
         well, it's crap, so no-one else does), which was a graphic collection
         by someone in Sonic Dreams (Rat I think).  Those guys were great fun,
         and some of them actully liked my music, which was a nice change, but
         goddamn the organisation of that group turned into a clusterfuck :-p,
         But it was all fun at the end of the day." (JJ)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Mitch_and_Dane/Archangel.sid
COMMENT: "Composed by M&D after having seen 'Get Shorty', a film that sported

         What happened was that c64 sceners gathered round a TV-set with a
         blasting speaker and contributed songs were played. This tune, M&D's

         make use of pulse width modification.
         For the 'zero page version' of this piece, I had cut down the player
         to almost nothing in order to get a real short file with as little
         raster time as possible. During that step, I removed the routine for

         My first finished attempt to write some techno. I love these harmless
         intros that are composed in an entirely different style than the rest
         of the piece! At the time I composed this piece, we had just learned
         how to write 3- and 4-voiced choir arrangements at school. For
         X-Radical of Nirvana." (OK)

         Ok, ok, this tune _is_ heavily inspired by the first music from Dutch
         Breeze, composed by Jeroen Tel. I even hand-ripped the snare drum and
         the bass sound from that piece. Anyway, I wrote this tune for
         Tardox/Vagabonds (now a member of Smash Designs) for his demo, a
         contribution to a demo competition by the magazine '64'er'." (OK)

         was quite successful (also because I ripped the trumpet sound from

         full of this tune - it was used in nearly all notes on the disk

         version, since I had an 800XE before C64. Anyway the C64 version is
         nearly the same. Maybe if I had known that Adam Gilmore made it
         also on C64, I wouldn't have covered it." (ZE)

/VARIOUS/M-R/PseudoGrafx/Partyzak.sid
COMMENT: "IMHO my worst tune because I was absolutely out of inspiration when

         - and I also had to make a picture for that report on the same day. My

         the same as the original. Made in February 1997. Sounds the best on

         released 'Apolloguys' the same day, and I had bought my Amiga 500 only
         2 weeks before coming to this party. The first screen featured 'Like
         Galway', and me writing a lot of text about who and what 'rambones'
         was. The middle screen was the 'Amiga Noid' screen, with a small
         picture of an Amiga, and a scroll telling that TST would soon rule it.
         The last one, with this music, was a 10 point list of things about the
         C64 that bored the hell out of me. Things like colorbars, sprites
         moving in sinus, Hubbard alike drums/routines, all with the same sound
         and generally everything that was in at that time. For me it was sad
         to see a large variety of composers using more or less the same

         program, but I could hear from Chris' and Banana's music that it
         definately was the way to go. So I asked Banana for some help. He sent

         Soundmonitor, and, not to my surprise, of course he was much better

         like this, as did he, but there's hardly any bass in it, because I try

         file I had forgotten over the years that passed. I decided to
         release it just for fun! If it hurts your ears, don't blame
         me, blame Jerry for undeleting it in the first place! :)" (PS)

         ANYTHING close to the original version, but... the reason why this one

         ofcourse trusted him. Shouldn't have done that ;)" (TRS)
         There exists an alternate version of U96's Love Sees No Colour called
         Version 2 (to be found on the Maxi Single CD) which is in fact a
         cover version of Trans-X's Living On Video. Hope this solves the

         Mostly bought by really old people. The title translated to English,
         would be something like "Divorcing Johanne". And not surprisingly, the
         tune is about a man who wants to get divorced ;) I do NOT listen to
         such music, the inspiration came from a techno-version of this made on

         means "very" or "very much", while "fatál" (with an accent) means
         "wooden plate" in Hungarian.
  TITLE: Magyar Népmesék (0:00)

COMMENT: Covers the title theme of a Hungarian animated series which featured

         a Hungarian folk song.

         the music for Circus Attractions while Ramiro had the pleasure of
         doing Rock'n'Roll. Now Chris hated circus music as much as Ramiro
         hated R'n'R. Therefore, Ramiro composed part of the Circus Attractions
         title music [and] Chris at some stage helped Ramiro with the R'n'R
         musics, but it is unclear in what way. [...]" (All info is from Miron

COMMENT: "Walker's Warbles" was a Martin Walker music demo which came as a free

         the music for.) Tune 3 is an early version of what would eventually be
         used in the game "Dominion" bundled on a Zzap! 64 covertape in 1990,
         and tune 4 is an early version of the "Aggressor Theme". The final
         version of this (and the one which Revolution uses) is the one on MW's
         "Zzap! 64 Music Demo" which appeared on Zzap 64's June 1989 covermount
         cassette. (Comment by Warren Pilkington)

         Whittaker used the same music in an Amiga game called SideWinder as

         Whittaker's permission, because the programmers of that game credited

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Action_Biker_Remix.sid
  TITLE: Action Biker, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Rob Hubbard
COMMENT: "This is a remix from Rob Hubbard's Action Biker main theme (#1) from
         the year 1985! (c) Mastertronic. Listen to the original and hear the
         difference! I first typed over the notes (bass + lead) from a Music
         Assembler example tune. Not using the ugly percussion track. The
         chords are typed over from a Midi file called Biker. (Lazy me eh?!).
         Maybe this will not be necessary in future because there is a Midi to
         Mod program and buddy Roland Hermans has made a Mod to Sid program.
         I'm not quite happy with this tune because of the weak 2 notes
         arpeggio part (from 1:14 to 1:50). I made the volume of this arpeggio
         part a bit softer so it becomes a bit less annoying. Maybe I will
         improve this tune sometime. Same presets used as in Rolfie Title
         Remix. Typing over the notes took some amount of time (I always work
         slowly!). I used too many sequences in the 2nd track (it can only
         handle 128). So Roland Hermans "packed" several sequences into only a
         few so the player can handle them. This is the 2nd tune for mainly
         Polish based group Axelerate. Tune is played at CIA 1 Timer A (PAL)
         because we wanted another speed than a normal one. Tune has nice
         ending, don't you agree? Hope you like it!" (JW)

COMMENT: "From the animated TV series "Yogi Bear" composed in 1960. This was

         me out but they couldn't. So I did it myself and there are no off key
         notes in this! Presets are from Parasol Stars tunes. An mp3 was the

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/All_B_ears_Turn_Disk.sid
COMMENT: "Own composed in true JW style! To get going making midi files I'm
         making a midi cover of this. I'd better make those chords notes
         slower (I want to go towards making music for a band). Instead of
         using slides I used Dane's technique (in Whistle song): a length 1
         note for some lead notes. Used as Turn disk music in my 1st music
         colly." (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Als_de_sterre.sid
   NAME: Als de sterre dao baove straole
COMMENT: "The demo in which this sound was spread contained the full lyrics of
         the song written in South Dutch dialect. This tune consists of a
         double lead to get a sort of echo effect. The reason why I made this
         song: In the south of Holland we celibrate Carnival each year around
         the end of February and because I live in a provence of Southern
         Holland called Limburg I decided to make one of the best Carnival
         songs on the C64! During Carnival everyone dresses up in some strange
         costume and goes into pubs to party and of course drink a lot of beer.
         The title of the song translated into English is: When the stars are
         shining up there. Written in waltz tempo. Hope you like it." (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Arabian_Nights.sid
COMMENT: "Demo containing this tune had a nice "gadget" enclosed. The drive led

         just came up with the title of this song after Roland changed
         something in the presets (instruments) which gave it an Arabian touch.
         Ok I think. Composed on piano." (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Beast_III_Title.sid
  TITLE: press fire [from the Amiga game Shadow of the Beast III]
 ARTIST: Tim Wright
COMMENT: "Of course I had to squeeze the Amiga 4 tracks in to c64's 3. But the
         tune uses 2 tracks for the part which isn't the lead or bass. How do
         you call that part anyway? (backing?) While going through old Amiga
         500 games with buddy Roland (we were looking through because we are
         planning a c64 demo consisting converted Amiga pics in FLI-Interlace)
         we stumbled upon this tune. I like it very much so I tried if I could
         rip it with my Datel Electronics' Amiga Action Replay MK III. I froze
         the game and typed in tracker. And golly yes! The cartridge found the
         tune and I saved it to disc and loaded it in my Protracker soundtool.
         Together with Roland I converted it. (He works much quicker than me).
         We are planning to do more conversions. After this conversion Roland
         made a program to convert from MOD to SID, right into my player as
         I said in Action Biker Remix STIL text. But now it even converts
         arpeggios! The presets are: bass from Psycho Pigs UXB. Flute resembles
         Amiga lead sample instrument but has a little waveform 41 tick at
         the beginning and is made by Roland. Other preset is from Henning
         Rokling's Henning_Rokling-02.sid which is used in demo Wild At Heart.
         We first made an arpeggio sound consisting of two different c notes
         but it didn't work out well. In beginning of the tune you can hear a
         build up of decay and sustain in this preset. To get this effect we
         had to make 4 presets just changing the decay and sustain from 2 to 8.
         The wave on effects on bass and Rokling preset make it sound ok on
         c64. Often this effect is used to substitute normal hi hat sounds.
         This ditty is one of my favourite tunes!" (JW)

         only tune they made which is cool. This C64 version is
         a bit faster, probably in an other key and is fast composed.

         looking for bass notes but never found any that sounded good! So I
         decided to let them out and use 2 voices for the lead. The idea to
         make this mini tune was that I coincidentally found a nice midi file
         on the net from which I only used the background. Preset of this is
         taken from Demon's Aural Manouvers II. I listened to the original TV
         theme on the BBC and was surprised to find out that I liked this

         time until I found out the notes were also in the chords. Kick sound
         was taken from a tune by Sad rest done by me and Roland. A midi tune

         music like players and presets etc. Some presets throughout this game

COMMENT: "This is the congratulations tune consisting a Follin like melody row
         of fast notes from a demo (forgot which one). The filter lead in the

         much like to leave the bass away at the end of "saxes" to get a nice
         "echo" effect." (JW)

COMMENT: "This level tune 1, a 2-voice zax made in a simple march tempo. The

         arpeggio's (chord substitutes). It's still ok, I guess." (JW)

COMMENT: "This is the bonus level tune. It's made a bit faster than the level
         tunes to get that hectic feel. Funny is the extreme fast part starting

          for the gfx competition on Vision 2003. I thought a nice
          picture needs a nice sound. Pity the music was not played
          during the gfx compo. This was changed in comparison with
          last year's party. Bass preset is from a Boogaloo sound,
          Matt Gray drums were surprisingly not taken from one of

         sawtooth presets to get that Galway feel. Bassline is simply using a C
         note and the C note an octave higher. Made in Music Assembler which
         was shortened by pally Roland Hermans, so it only occupies memory from
         $1000-$12EF on the C64 which is 3 blocks (less than 1 K!). Neil
         Baldwin's Demonic-Part_1 was an example for me, using 2 tracks for

         made back in '92. The rest was made in 2 weeks in 2001. At the party
         sids are played up to 4 minutes. So I had to stop at the end of the

         an old sid, as was done on the party. You had to mention on the entry
         sheet which sid they had to use. Too bad the music was played too soft
         on the party (held during Easter). The zax might be a bit too

COMMENT: "This is my Mekka Symposium 2001 SID competition entry. It finished
         11th from the 29 and got 32 votes. Too bad there is no independent
         jury on the Mekka party so if you know a lot of people who will vote
         for you, you will finish 1st. The first part (from 0:00 to 0:45) was
         made back in '92. The rest was made in 2 weeks in 2001. At the party
         sids are played up to 4 minutes. So I had to stop at the end of the
         4th minute. Since this msx contains a sample beat it must be played on
         an old sid, as was done on the party. You had to mention on the entry
         sheet which sid they had to use. Too bad the music was played too soft
         on the party (held during Easter). The zax might be a bit too
         long-winded. The DD III part was converted from an Amiga MOD" (JW)

          Original was from 1988 and used some bad presets.
          Bass and fluty presets were made by Roland H. and lead
          is again from Robocop. This tune was always one of my

         slide effect had to be inserted which wasn't in the other Parasol
         Stars tunes. This zax sounds a bit like the old Latin Lambada tune by
         Kaoma from 1987. Of course this tune was played during the game after

COMMENT: "This is a conversion of an Amiga Octamed file I found on the net. It
         was my entry for the Vision party 2001. It was the best music but
         since there were not enough entries, all entries were put into 1
         competition. It finished 4th. All presets were done by buddy Roland
         Hermans which very much sound like the Amiga ones. Great job! I always
         wanted to convert this tune and fortunately I found the Med files
         which saved me from very much work. 11 presets were used among a
         filter bass preset. I really like this tune! Anyone also wants to make
         a complete game conversion?" (JW)

         tune in it done by Harti. But his version was much slower, divided
         the background notes over 2 tracks and left out a piece of the
         original. It sounded nice but without wanting to sound arrogant I like
         my version better! All presets done by Roland! It finished 3rd on the
         Vision 2003 music compo which made me win 2 c64 related cds!" (JW)

/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Rolfie_Title_Remix.sid
COMMENT: "This is a remix of the title theme I made for a children's cd rom I
         am making together with some pallies of mine. The cd rom is called
         "Rolfie Op Wereldreis" which is translated: "Rolfie On A World Trip"
         and is about a cat which travels around the world visiting 10
         countries from which England and America are divided into 2 pages. So
         in total there are 12 different country drawings, a title page, a
         credits page and and end page. With every page there comes an
         appropriate, spheric music plus lyrics about what can be seen in the
         drawings. All the sight seeing objects can be seen in a picture of
         each country. For instance in Egypt you can see: some pyramids, a
         sphinx, the Nile, a palm tree, some background items and Rolfie the
         cat on a camel. When you click on an object it starts to animate and a
         WAV-file begins to play making e.g. a camel sound and telling a story
         about e.g. a camel. This title tune is apart from the melody altered
         heavily to let it sound ok on the C64. This is the first tune I made
         since 1992 which was spread, so you can call it a sort of test tune.
         And this is also the first tune made for mainly Poland based group
         Axelerate which has died in the beginning of 2001. All presets are the
         same as in Linko music except before every bass sound (from 0:15),
         there is a kick drum sound added. Idea for 3 track chords in beginning
         is from Reyn Ouwehand's Deadlock (brilliant title tune). Wind sound
         was added, as always if something needs to be added, it was done by
         pally Roland 'Neo' Hermans. Hope U like it!" (JW)

         the beginning of the game. Bass and percussion were put into 1 track.
         Some wave on sounds were put on the presets of the track with the fast

         Hermans, who is a good programmer) got some tips from Charles how to
         get an oriental sound by making appropiate presets (instruments) using
         arpeggio's and flute sounds. As you can hear much transpose is used in

         found on the net. All presets are the same but the bass
         preset is a bit softer. This preset is from Jonathan Dunn's
         Robocop. Very nice pulse thingy in it. The lead from 1:55
         is done by me. Original was played by piano as only
         instrument." (JW)

COMMENT: "The 3rd Glass cover partially covered from a midi file. It didn't
         work out as well as I had expected but however it is a bit short it's
         ok I guess. It's the eight tune used in Arachnophobia mag #24 which
         makes that mag a true Yogibear special! What I learned from this tune
         is that the $11 wave form (in this case flute sound) is a good choice
         to use for the 2nd lead voice which is of course less dominant than
         the 1st. Thanx again to Neo for helping with the presets but in the
         future I hope I can do them myself as I'm learning how my music player
         and the SID chip works." (JW)

  TITLE: Air Combat (level 3) [from the Amiga game Turrican III]

COMMENT: "Another MIDI file conversion taken from the Video Game Music Archive
         (www.vgmusic.com). It was first intended to be a high score music for
         a shoot'em up from Protovision, but they didn't want covers in their
         games. Roland and I first put the filter on the arpeggios like Robocop
         title but in most cases it is best to put it on the bass like we did
         in this tune. I think this is one of the best basslines I ever heard.
         It's pretty complex! Chris is/was probably the best German computer
         zax composer ever. I think! The arpeggios are not chords they consist
         of 2 notes. Lead is from Dunn's Robocop title, rest by Roland. Hope U

         party entry called Mega Turrican (GFX). And that's what I did. That
         background preset thingie was taken from X-Out, which was used there
         as lead. Again a midi file was the basis for this one. From 0:50 an
         extra effect was added courtesy Roland. Thanx! I must say it sounded
         really cool on the party with that thumping bass! As you can hear the

         Arachnophobia diskmag. All anthems can be found in a cd rom
         encyclopedia as midi file. I took the dominant lead and the bass from

         use Protracker. It was meant for a C64 game Roland and I planned to
         make (Red Baron) which was never finished. The funny thing with the
         game was that you had to put the telly or monitor on its side! So you
         got an arcade feel to the game.  This tune was used in a note spread

         It's complete lack of relevance to Volfied is because I originally did

         and wanted to use it as the intro." (MW)

         game. I did it after reading in some magazine about a possible C64
         conversion, and sent it Mirrorsoft "on spec" I don't know if the 64
         version was ever done, and if it was it didn't have my music in it."
         (MW)
         Actually, every conversion of Xenon 2 that had any music at all was
         covering this music.

/Winterberg_Michael/
COMMENT: "It's a long time ago that I composed sounds for the good old C64. But
         all I remember is that it was a very great time with much fun.
         My composing started in the years 1983/84 when I programmed my own
         music-editor and the music-play-routine. I made an extra-routine for
         each sound. From music to music I changed that routine to get
         different sounds.
         I have made some musics, good and bad sounds. But I have tried to make
         people happy with listening to my music." (Comment by Winterberg

  TITLE: Autumn
 ARTIST: Jori Olkkonen (Yip)
COMMENT: Another version of Yip's tune from Scroll Machine, played using a
         simpler music routine, because the original music routine interfered
         with the game's code: "I had to ask Jori to make the music with
         slightly less sparse synching, but when I did that the sound quality
         dropped a bit. The result was a bearable compromise. The screen
         glitches were almost gone and the music still sounds fairly good."
         (From an interview with Pasi Hytönen, the programmer of the game, in
         MikroBITTI 4/87)
