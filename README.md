The [High Voltage SID Collection](https://www.hvsc.c64.org/) in Git format
===

Why? Well, I've had a copy or two of the [HVSC](https://www.hvsc.c64.org/) on my machine for over a decade now,
and never know which version it is, and never look forward to updating it.

With this repository you can simply clone it (if you're familiar with Git,)
and update it whenever you feel like it.

I have no contact with the HVSC people,
so I don't know when updates are released.
Please feel free to open an issue asking for an update, or a PR with an update.

I've checked in a lot of older versions for fun.
I'm not sure what use that is,
but remember you can "shallow clone" so you don't spend time transfering those versions.
